Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Joey.
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I did.
Queen Harry?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
As in...
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I just wanted --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Dead at forty-one.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
That's never been proven
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
And why would I do that?
You know who The Raincoats are?
I say, do what you wanna do.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I didn't care about the money.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
You decided.
Bianca did what?
Hi.
What?
Just for now.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Touch of the flu.
Absolutely not.
We'll all go crazy...
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Your life, and that of others!
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
This time with me!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Island.  Far.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
A woman?
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Immediately.
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Here.  I have your money.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Divorced.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
In the kitchen.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I let her take a shower.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Hmmmm.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Just a shower?
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright?
Alright.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
See you later.  Good luck.
I am butcher.
Get down on your knees.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
I want to document my trip to America.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Shut up.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Be quiet.  Watch.
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Oh?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
I guess it isn't.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
And don't you worry about it.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
I understand.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
I never paid for it in my life.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
I got a lot to protect.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Want to try it again?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
That's never been one of my problems.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
They saved your ass, convict.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You just drove by it.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Hello. And goodbye.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Yeah, I read the report...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
How did they get away?
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
What's wrong with that?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Just a second, that's all!
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Sure, right.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Not bad, not bad.
Five.  On credit.
You know exactly where they are!
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
I know...
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
It's like a cab isn't it?
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
Gentlemen?
Amen..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
I'm not at the hotel!
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Okay, I believe you.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Honey, I'm not, please...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
What?
I just talked to her.
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
I promised him to Machine.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Machine.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Move it, dirtbag... !
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
I figured you share information.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Yeah.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Three, four years.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Twenty-five.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Great.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
He succeeded.
I'm telling you it's not that.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
What was she running from?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
What... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
No...
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
Yes.  I remember her.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
What?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
What?
It was bad.
Then we'll stay up together.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Enough of that crap.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
She doesn't want me around
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Very funny.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Mark!
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Who?
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Faint.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Oh it does???
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Anything ---
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
But - what can we accomplish?
Minus three.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Who?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Same old shit.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Yeah.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Mmm.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
In the chest.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
You know.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Huh?
You don't want the extra police pay?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Want to buy?
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Yeah. I mean that.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Then... I guess you have to.
Of course! I would've heard.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Sleeping.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Then who shot him?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I'm sorry, honey.
That's not really the point.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Jim... for godsake!
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Alice... I...
Did we warn them off?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Put your pilot on.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Roger.
A secret service agent. It must be.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
How can you? I mean they're people.
No.
One thing I've learned as
Twenty minutes?
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I was reading too.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
I mean until we start to burn up.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Scraps.
You're sure?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Yes. Yes, of course.
Well...
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
But if you'll just give me...
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
What is it?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
And that fits?
How the hell do you know that?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Uh, Matthew...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
This is mole.  It's good.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Stop the car!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
But there's no more drug.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
You?
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
His Grace is very angry with you.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
No.
You might be disappointed.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Extremely clever.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
And how will you make him keep it?
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
What are you talking about?
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Why? People fart backwards.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm-tee.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Oh, damn!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Oh, Stanzi.
Why?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Madame. How can I help you?
Tonight?
Alone.
He needs me, ma'am.
And I'm asking you -
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Money! Money!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Gertrude!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
May I try it?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
What do you mean, Sire?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Good morning, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
In there, sir.
What medicine?
Opera? Opera!
That's right.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
So there you are. What do you say?
Because there's nothing to see.
What for?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
How fortunate.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Did my work please you?
What work?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Oh, yes.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
What do you want?
Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I've seen the manuscript.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Yes, Doctor?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
It was a wolf.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
My best friend. My very best friend.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Do me an enormous favor?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I should be committed.
Pull over.
No what?
No.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
I was having a nightmare.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Where am I?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
That's a wolf's head.
Okay.
Right.
You ask them.
Beware the moon?
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Come on, where?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
I can't stand it.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Get out of here, Jack!
A monster. I know, I know.
You must believe me.
Thank you.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I want you to meet some people.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
What here?
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Then you have some hot tea?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Oh!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Me?
Well, you can. You always could.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah?
I'm listening.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Yes.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
No, sir.
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
Is it safe?
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Come here, honey!
Oh, Matt.
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
He was here?
Yes, sir.
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I'm okay, Matt.
Never a good thing.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Twenty?!
You're forgetting who's in charge --
A bad idea.
A trap.
The brown one.
Cole, he didn't mean that.
You're right, sir.
It's a secret.
Shit.
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
We're gonna have to talk...
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Say your prayers?
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Boys?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Last February?
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
I'm not hanged yet.
Fair enough.
Thank you.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Not at all.
Good.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
How much did they get from the safe?
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
I look forward to seeing it.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
In English, Pinkerton.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Are we here?
Oh God, just get it over with.
I don't want to talk about it.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Yes, I am.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
It looks so soft.
Where are you going?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
When?
Patrick?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Oh no. I have no plans.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No, I'm okay.
Understandable.  Lime?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Hang...out?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
People just...disappear.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
So...you hang out here a lot?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
You saved my life in alot of ways.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
I can't just walk away!
Nothing.
What?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Oh, right. Hold on.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Wanna be a part of history?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
We could move 'em up here.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
What're you implying.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
Gary, don't worry, we --
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Those really weird, short lines.
Got out of my other commitment.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm calling Gary.
You know mine.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Certainly not at my happy home.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
I met this girl.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
She's a programmer?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Yeah, yeah.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
We know all that, Exposition.
Be careful.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Carnies.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Yes Basil?
Why not? It's a question.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I never forget a pussy... cat.
Why?
Oh, yes you are.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Not in the Nineties.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Not now, Austin.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'll secure the perimeter.
Kiss me.
Behave!

Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
We don't judge here.
And how do you feel about that?
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.

Three days.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Sir August...?  What now?
I have an appointment.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
Then who wins?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
You're mad.
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Then what's stopping you?
Or half cocked.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Why should they think that?
How on earth can you tell?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
That's what we were working on.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
No trouble.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
As far as you trust me.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Decontamination -- ?
Who's now vanished.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Global warming?
We want Mrs. Peel.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Possibly. Split personality ...
She may try to kill you.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
The last one you'll ever see.
Perish the thought.
But did they teach you this?
That's not playing by the rules.
Did I? My mistake.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Hey, man, congratulations!
When do the girls get to the party?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
But a fabulous cook.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
What's going on?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
I'm not really hungry.
The best table in the house.
About what?
Oooooo.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Not likely.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
That was never proved.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Thanks for the insight.
What are we going to do about this?
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Thanks for calling.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
I wanted to be a good one.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Yes.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Then who --
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Pest control.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Every little boy's fantasy.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
Swayzak's not my boss.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
Didn't think you'd make it.
I know you.
And old ladies?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I might.
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
You mean you could use it.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
B-L-A-K it is.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Yeah, him.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
I'm a revolutionary.
I'm out.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
No offense.
How much?
That can be done.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I'm wid it.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
Is that so?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Your father is proud of you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Do you know how you will use him?
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
The big one.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
You tellin' the truth.
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
...like grits and butter...
What else?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
You leave something out?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
And his baggage?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
I don't know.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
Then you must get it.
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Good night, my little darling.
I beg your pardon?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Who?
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
I just don't like it.
What do you like then?
You did Basic here?
I'm not telling you what happened.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
He's lying.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Do I?
Yeah...
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
Stop.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
MAYBE WHAT --
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
And the problem is you only got three.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
He's in interrogation?
Why?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
So noted.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Watch me.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Let's go talk to Bill...
Good idea.
Good, just making sure.
Right back where we started.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Shut up!
Yeah.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's not Army, it's not official --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
No one's ever left.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
How would you describe him?
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Was she nekkid?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
How did you know?
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
No, I understand.
Well, it's not a short one.
Okay.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
I'm not scared.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You owe me three-fifty.
You're right.
Dad?
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I need you on my side.
We rented a car.
How much time does he have left?
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Such as?
What do you mean?
Good. 
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
Uh. Do you like England?
No. It's not that.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
You don't understand anything.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
I don't hate you.
Sometimes.
Some... What does that mean?
So now you hate all women?
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
Please, there's no... Oh.
I don't have nothing.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I don't want anyone to die.
Whatever.
It's not mine either.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
You gonna miss your bus.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
LAZ, I said let...!
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Two days?
Why you got me chained?
No ma'am.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Uh-uh.
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
I can handle that.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
What I love.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yes'sir.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
Are you wasted?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Beats forty hours on a plane.
I said let's go, Charlie.
You all right?  You okay?
Hey, all right.
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Give us a break...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
A snitch?
Nick...
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Gaiijin.
Shut-up.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
I want to go talk to him.
What...?  Why?
So I bring some cheese?
No.
Why's that?
Call for help.
Gaiijin?
He's on duty.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Then go get him.
Oh?
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Also extraordinary things.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Thank you.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
Your customer, eh?
You start.
Longevity is classified.  No.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
What if you change your mind?
But if you could?
Do you recognize any of them?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Does it eat?
Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Me and my dad.
How are you doing?
That's another thing I can't do.
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Hmmm?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
You mean a woman?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Just wait here.
No.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Sorry.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Don't move.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
But how come I'd be there?
They left.
Your mom was a dancer?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Oh, that's nice.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Right.
Oh, I could die...
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
What for?
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Everybody's divorced.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
The engine is still running.
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Look unimpressed.
And don't be so obvious!
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Did you?
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
I've got to go, now.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
1959.
Russia.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
True.
Why not? He has great pants.
Oh. I see.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Goodnight.
Up there!!
Really? No kidding?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
No.  They all do.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
What shall we call him?
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
We do?
What are you doing here?
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
I think...it...works.
Always good advice.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He left with Sophie.
You're goddamn right I am!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Yeah! That's thinking.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Buy it from me?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Okay honey.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Okay.
Why do you do it?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Nobody.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
What do you want?
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
What?
No. What is happening?
Same here.
Don? Are you in with them?
Come on Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I'm glad you do.
I did. Are you?
It's okay. It's okay.
My secret lover.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Nothing.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. okay.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Hey Jeff.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What else is new? Right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Now, how are you going to do that?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Let's go.
Why not?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
No.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
Look under the body.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
This is a six-shooter.
You sound real remorseful.
What happened?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Ma, what's wrong?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
We... met them last night.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
No pictures, either.
Just like on TV.
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Then what the fuck?
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
How do you figure?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Why was I not informed of this?
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
So?
What the fuck do you mean?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Fuck you Vincenzo.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
She's an attractive older woman.
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
That sets it off.
Hang on a second.
You think we're going to be chased?
Nothing. Go ahead.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Hi.
They don't?
Don't worry about it, Bob.
If you say so.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Where's the rest?
$383.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
He seems pretty good.
It's like we've finally arrived.
As a person?
It's going back down.
I'll see you there.
What?
What are you talking about?
There's not enough time.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
We're not sure.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
No, I don't mind.
Why do you say that?
Jesus Christ! No.
Yeah.
Uh-uh.
The front stairs.
Is that Buckethead?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Let's cut the bullshit.
Good question.
God DAMMIT.
He wouldn't move.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
What are you talking about?
I'm going back.
Just get in the car, Bob.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
He's having a heart attack or something.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
What can we do?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And the Landy woman?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Don't know.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
It was staged?
Okay... 
I speak English.
That's not what happened to your parents.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
Felt a little light.
It's just a nightmare.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- where's left to go? --
-- it's just him? --
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I did.
That's a lie!
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
I'm working on it.
What? The tapes?
Who's this?
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Amnesia?
So he fooled you.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
Hamish, I... thank...
Fourteen? --
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
That depends on the man.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
It matters not, he is thy king!
You are. And I'll come again.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
Who would do such a thing?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
But you must have something to go on?
Can't he come out for one day?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Sure...
I don't know. These things take time.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
You know my father?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Where are you now?
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
I'm sorry.
So how's Tommy?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
I know, but...
Those are your clothes, silly.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Because you're... different.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
...yes.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
And you are...?
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Wow... read something.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, Monsieur.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Well, so long.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Not an easy day to forget.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
How do you do?
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Here it is.
Very well.
I slept very well.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
-- You thought what?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
I like it fine here.
Good. Then have a drink.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
No water, no work.
Do too much, I'll die.
No.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Then we've just got shit.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Had a package to deliver.
Not if you work for FedEx.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Don't even start.
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
My epitaph.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Yeah?
I don't know.  I really don't know.
You too.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Yeah.
Let's eat.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
What about the sender?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
For the third time.
To Wilson.
That's what it's about.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
You cook very well!
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
People watched the movies in their cars?
"King Kong". It's really good.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
He's leaving...
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Is that soon?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Is it true?
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
I haven't read that.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
But you don't look very happy.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
That's it.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
There'll be red flags.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gee... What makes you say that?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
So what? We hide, right?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Two million.
Minus one.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I need you to stake me.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
We're not cops.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
I gotta go get a haircut.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Escorts!
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
What are you talking about?
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
Habib?
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
And your lady?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You want me drunk?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Leave it.
You will?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Impossible to calculate.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
I'll watch.
Who's they?
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What for?
Thank you.
How are you?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
And what do you do, Lucy?
I might.
Over the river.
Some other time.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
What for?
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Eventual supernova.
Doolittle, are you there?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Energy shielding positive function.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Armed.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Bomb?
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
And you can only do it once, right?
Hmmm...
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Not now!
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Yeah?
Ah... pity, pity...
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
I'm on a break.
What're you talkin' about?
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
That's a lotta crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
You didn't...
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Girl's gotta make a living.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Bent?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
The other ones?
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
You said you could help.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Okay, okay.
I understand.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
Okay, okay, okay--
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
I-I c-can't...
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Nah. Couldn't be.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
It's my Bullworker.
What's gone?
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Go ahead, Jam.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
We won?!
Hello summer detention.
Let's lift up her shirt.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Yeah.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Take it off. I want to see you.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Where it came from?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
I met a girl.
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
That I did it again.
I think now that he might...
Why?
Thank you.
Guess who wrote it?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Gerald.
Come again?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
What else?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Yeah, you betcha...
Thank God for bunge cords.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Huh?
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
What?!
We was robbed.
You heard me. Where is it?
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Yes, Leslie!
Hi.
Hi.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
Enid ate a whole pan!
Close up shop!
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
He should be king!
"My dear President"...
Is that all?
Send for my car...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Yes -- why?
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
'At's-a fine.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
I can't do it right away.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
You upstart!
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
No... it was a seven letter word.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
One or two?
I've always thought that myself.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
Shut up!
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Good morning, sir.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Yes sir.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
...I learned a long time ago.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
But, Erik...
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
REALLY?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Yes?
Why?
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Shut up.
Oh, get it over with.
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
Odin!
I know!
Look... Erik...
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Like fish.
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Arrgh!
Vanish into thin air?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Got you!
Hang on...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
I'm drowning! Help!
Dad!
Neither am I.
No one.
And I just liked you so much.
In the room?
In the world.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Really? Because --
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
It's okay.
I don't know.
It's pretty.
I'm fine.
I know a man who needs a refill.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Oh, yeah.
When?
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
No, it isn't that.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I love it!
This is our first "date" date.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
And I didn't have an argument.
It's very late.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
It's freezing out here.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I guess so.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I'm like a joke to them.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I don't know! I just said that!
I swear.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Yes?
Thanks.
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
He went home sick.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Siwash, huh?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Easy come, easy go.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I'm staying with the Countess.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichs and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
So now you're bummin' around?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Your ranch?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Will it work?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Roger that.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
It gets worse.
How do you know all this?
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin. I won't let you die.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
...how's the client?
Do it.
The date.
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
You're lying...!
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
He served on the Goliath.
They're explosive charges.
There's no one here.
Not according to the computer.
It's cold.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
And you can? Power it up?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben. Are you okay?
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Give me a mirror...
And they're changing into...
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
Not this again --
What about you?
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
I was talking about us. Working together.
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Sue... look at your hands.
We need to get past them.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Not at all.
Ben did this?
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Oh, I think you already have.
Skeptical...?
You want to work at Carl's?
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
There it is!
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
All right, then. It's your secret.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
But they weren't mine.
Dad says!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I know what I look like.
You first.
How about both of us at the same time?
What? Are you all right?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Yeah?
Okay. See ya.
Yes.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I can't do that.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
No.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yes.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Thanks. So do you.
You keep them.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Crying? Why was she crying?
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Hell, no!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
Can we make it?
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
How about a check?
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Who the hell would you call?
OPEN THE DOOR!
And the rest of 'em?
Fuck you too.
What?
Look.
Fuck no.
Oh yeah?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Sure.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
Good.
What do you mean what?
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Whoa!
No bullshit.
I'm sure.
Amazing you made it this far.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
All right.
We all have to be strong, right?
Um, well...
You see: We've got to change that name.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Huh.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
What does Clifford say?
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Who?
Claire?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
You want his name?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
He's a socialist, then?
Please, Francie...
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
You think I'd miss it?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
You don't know what you want.
Oh no...
Eight stories.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
No, they don't, do they?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
I took the early rounds.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Huh?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
What's that?
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Will you marry me?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
That would be okay.
You got it.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You kill me, Mama.
Mama...?
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
I see.
Normal. Average.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Frances, I'm warning you...
No!
I am as he made me. In his own image.
And he drove me to mine.
Better that way... for me.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
A brain. Extremities.
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
Is he not back yet?
It's far too late for him to still be out.
God took her from us.
Your decision. For us.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
It is
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
No. But someday.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
It's a letter to my father.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
They'll hang him all the same.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
I was careless.
Thanks, Alice.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Maybe I can help?
Well, it hasn't been that long.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Thanks.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
I love you.
You? The brick?
There you are dead wrong.
Aw.
For two lonely nights.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
The truth hurts.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
How'd she die?
Died instantly?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I don't have the slightest idea.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Forever together.
In other words, no.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Anytime.
Later.
-- you got your shower --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
You can't come in here.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How do you know?
What?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
What?
We are?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
That's what you look like.
You're lookin' green.
Where are you?
No problem, lieutenant.
That's what I hear.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Don't say my name.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
I'll act surprised.
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
California.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
What changed?
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
I can make this wall without --
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Is this my glory, sir?
Just like you would be.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
I don't know, I don't care.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
And how do you know that?
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
If you got a good one, Wick...
I think you look beautiful.
You heard me.  Move on.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
"Dad."
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
15, sir.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
The first female President?
Women.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I got pretty close.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
I'll try.
And how should we do that, Sir?
They are with me!
It's Tatopoulos.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Thanks.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
I won't and nothing you say-
Leadership....
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
No I didn't.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay...  Okay, now what.
What do you mean?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Okay, now. But-
Wait two seconds then go.
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
I don't know.
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
But...Why?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Oh god...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
The army can survive without me.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
You go too far, Benedict.
Yes, general?
Yes, general.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
Unofficially, General Greene.
What's the difference?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
I'm very aware of that.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
George, I'm sorry.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
You're kidding me, right?
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Who?
What about him?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
We'll get it later.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
That's the magic number.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Depends. Who's this?
Never heard of him.
Whatever you want, Ray.
I don't like waiting.
I'm a producer.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, look at me.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
I'm up twelve grand today.
Here's another tip...
Maybe you don't see my sign?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
I know what a vig is.
A real bargain.
Rough day on the set?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Right. See how your story ends.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
I don't know.
That's what the guy said.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Hm?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
You seem to feel fine about it.
How honorable of you.
Shylock?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Thanks.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Oh yeah.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Three, four days.
She take a radio?
How about you Epps?
Don't lie to me!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
If money can buy what he wants.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Yeah. Thanks.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
What?
If it was a ship she hit.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
I don't know, are we?
Showing you what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Epps, over.
Right here.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
Alright. I'll be right up.
You're up late.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Say what?
Better late than never.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Who?
Maxine.
Yup.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
What?
About what?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
But I can't --
JUST DO IT!
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Why?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
That's just the way I am!
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Are you ready to go?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What? Why?
In fact, never.
You loser!
I've been looking all over for this.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
Which loser?
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Bingo!
Come on, it's too late now...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Wait...
No way... when?
You cunt!
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
No, really...
You're insane.
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
So where's all your stuff?
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Where did you get those pants?
That tape sucked, by the way!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
A dollar seventy-five.
Hey, I was only kidding!
Really? Can I see it?
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Jesus!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
It's not hopeless...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Yeah, but still...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Never...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
YAAA!
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
...I better not...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
I... I don't think so.
In whatever way you think I mean.
Do you have anything to drink?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
What about Joe?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I have no idea - I just want to...
What do you mean?
Why don't we start with that next week?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Well, I need to speak to him.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
That is correct.  Nothing.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Might be exciting for you.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Somehow I guessed. 
Nonsense.
Thank you, Samuel.
Once... 
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Okay, let's take a look.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Command me, lord.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Yes.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I don't even want to know where that is.
I knew that.
From where -- Neptune?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
No, the slime is rising.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, Ray --
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Well don't think!
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I am Zuul.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I want to help you.
Is he dying or something?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Talk to my accountant. 
Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
Yes, it would.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
A square?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Two wavy lines?
I'm always serious.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Don't cross the beams.
What is it?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
For what purpose?
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
How do you know?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
For the gods, spit it out!
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
We have to stop the Germans now!
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
They're studying with Cynics.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
No.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Of course not.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
What?
Ah. Where?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Yes.
But you're not enrolled.
-- really incredible --
What did she say?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't know.
I don't see how we can.
I have to go back now.
Yes.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Thank you.
Ahhh.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
Give me an hour.
A single room or a double room?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Right.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
No.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
It's all right.
All right. Now finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Her portrait?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Right.
Yes, I have --
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
What?
Yes.
Yes?
What?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
This is all terribly wrong.
You can admit that, can't you?
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
There!
No we don't.
Man, is this interesting.
See if you can guess.
At college.
No.
There's nothing to tell.
I have my reasons.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
What?
Did I say that?
Of course you did.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Where is Elaine?
What the hell have you done?
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
Have you thought about graduate school?
You got me.
I've got to go.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
I will.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
But why?
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
Yes.
The pearls are in her room.
Why?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
How?
I have an idea working in my head... 
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Aren't you?
What?
All right. We'll dance.
Will you do me a big favor?
Strange man...
Go away. Who are you --?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I want to be alone.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Really?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
So --
You do believe that I really love you?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well -- last night was not so good.
And the child isn't coming?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No, doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
A man might what?
You dance splendidly.
Preysing?
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Later?
Moreover... 
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Moreover...
Perhaps. 
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
I must go to England -- at once.
Of course -- of course. 
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
Baron!
Here, hold up!
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I mean with the Manchester people?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All right.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
We did not approach you.
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
No. No word.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
What do you want with her?
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
You expect me to buy this?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
No.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Hah.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Fine.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
So here we are!
We're not really interested, Henry.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
I know.
What is?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
Well, that's good news.
I've really got to --
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Let's find out.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
You called the doctor, huh?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
And when he got serious?
I thought these people were broke.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
I'm happy the way I am.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
What?
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
No shit?!
And miss the big game?  No way.
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
My life is a living hell.
I know.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I was trying to get away from someone.
Yes.
No.
I'm not leaving without her.
Please, get on the bus...
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
That would work.
Why not?
Who?!
Still wants to move out?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
The serial killer?
Yeah.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
Can't you hold it?
You're unbelievable.
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
Where's Shane?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
Why?  You interested?
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
This is madness, Wynn.
Stay away, Sam.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
No one.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Tell them yourself!
I didn't tell you everything.
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
What'll you do for transportation?
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
How about breakfast, wife?
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
I dunno.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Pass the fucking catsup.
You're making a joke.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
For Africa.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Can't it keep till morning?
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Will you go to bed?
No.
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Sir?
Some kind of animal?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
You used to like it stark!
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Which one?
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Hope.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
No.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Yes.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
I'm high as a kite.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I'm an honorable clown?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
With spittle?
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
Jesus.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
What's this?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's alive!
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
He can hardly talk.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Something happens to my confidence.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
It is?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
What kind of a life is that?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Yeah.
No, I don't.
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
Wait?
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Up front?
I am.
You don't drink?
A friend.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Yeah, yeah, go on.
On your own land?
What makes you so sure?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
That's right.
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
I don't know.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
I want to meet Ratan.
Rucker.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sounds all right.
What do you think of that? Or this?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Oh, I don't have one.
No, no. I just took it.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
Out!
Is this your shovel?
No.
Then whose name is it registered in?
What kind of a car is it?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
I don't know.
Harold Chasen.
No, thank you. I have my car.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
She seemed yare to me.
No. 
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Look.
Over there by the courthouse.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Did Confucius say that?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
Well, don't go.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Well, they're my species.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
For you.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Fifteen.
And a lot of time.
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Why?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Souvenirs?
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Julia.
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
It's been Hell.
We don't take hints.
I'm lucky that way.
Oh, right --
See? I don't like that --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
From where??!!
That makes him more than a hundred --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Who wards off demons.
I worry about you.
Is it bad?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
I knew those men better than you did --
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
I wish I could be more gracious but --
No. Don't --
Alone?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
We're leaving.
Her mother's dead.
I have to speak to my father.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
Oh Christ.
Come to Daddy.
Some things have to be endured...
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Later.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Shit.
Let me see.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
Where are you?
YOU'D like my room.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Steve?
Maybe you should give it some time.
I want to see.
Yes!
I AM house-trained.
I thought we'd lost you.
If there's a train.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
If I make it through the day.
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What's next?
Play it.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Suck my ass.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Oh well.  Nevermind.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
What are you talking about?
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Yeah, sure...
Hey Rob.
Okay.
Yeah.
Do it.  Do it.
Who's that?
You look upset.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
Great... That's great.
Have you slept with him yet?
I'm not -- hold on...
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
Is that the last of it?
What do you mean?
It'll have to be sex, then.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Okay.
You know the difference.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
I'm alright.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Well, you've asked.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Good.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Whiskey.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Fine.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
You're the expert.
-Okay okay.
Tradition.
What the hell is going on?
Where?
Dupont Circle.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
That's impossible.
Why are you here?
He knows about you.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Now there's a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
It'll never stick.
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
We are brothers.
Go to hell.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
I feel hardly nothing.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
You're wrong.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Finish yours?
So sure?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
We have no understanding.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Either you are with me or against me.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Thanks.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
I don't know.
How many came?
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
I've had a few more concerns.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Are you here?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
That's none of your business.
I presume it's a sword.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Same.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Open this door!
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
But --
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Please! Will you just --
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
What for?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Yes. Where is he?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Is this the Community Hospital?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
I always have both.
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Me, too.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Who engineered this getaway?
I can't complain.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
No, I couldn't do that.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
All right, Judge.
Phone for you, Hildy.
I thought so, too.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl. 
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Forty dollars.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
No, she didn't.
What's that?
Yes.
OK. You're in.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
The sodding water table.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
A bit too quick.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Bugger the Buffs.
I will if you will!
You joined up.
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
Where to?
Just ignore her, Mac.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Out.
Who said anything about love?
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
What about R.J.?
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Holy crap, thanks!
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Hell yeah.
How much further?
I don't know.
What's that?
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Turn that fucking radio off!
Lock the fucking doors.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Fine! I'll go straight!
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Tickets for what?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
She looks like she stinks.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Recover any bodies?
You find something, Georgie?
Open up the trunk.
Yes, sir.
Where's Bill?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Fit the profile?
Shit... fuck procedure.
I always favored the Hulk.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
What is it?
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Okay.
Very well.
But I like being human now.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Ouch. Yeah?
Shut up and tell me.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Three foot one.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
With pleasure.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
We are animals after all.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
What?
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Your entire body?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
No.
Really?
Sure. Of course.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Really?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Tomorrow, the acid test.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
You know what's good for him?
Cut.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
I got drunk.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
To do what?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Hi. How's business?
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
You want me to tell her for you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Fifty per cent?
Who's he?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Eddie...
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I told you you'd get your money back.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Glad to meet you.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. Sure.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Shoot.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Yes.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Oh, it's not bad.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Give it back to me.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
You wanna drink?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
You need the words?
I feel pretty.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Sure. Let's go home.
Why should I?
Well, what's the matter?
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Where you lived with them.
Yes.
Who?
What?
If we want it, it is.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Good night.
Why, yes.  Why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
No.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Let's try.
What?
He's a good man.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
What's the bad news?
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
What happened?
You punched the President in the face?
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
David, you're drunk.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
Yes, Sir.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Then find them.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
Sorry for what?
Really? Ballet?
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I hear you.
It's all fuzzy.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Air... water... your "sun."
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
It looks like a converted church.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Arghhh! Oh!
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Schneider?
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
How dare he?!
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Yes?
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
All I have to do is scream.
Don't call me that, please.
Through the library?
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Dad!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Marcus would agree with me.
Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
Good.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
I don't know. We'll find out.
Junior...
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
What?
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
What evil?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
First of all -- don't panic!
It's starting to let go!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Just try and control yourself.
A what?!
I'm going down.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Go!
Who's you?
Al ???!!!
This candid camera?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
You said it.
Are you crazy?
Yeah.
Why don't you?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Why? AL  You know too much.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
You are CRAZY!
What do you mean we.
I'll sue.
What am I supposed to do?
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Oh yeah, to what?
Eating sushi?
What is it?
Good Idea!
I don't want to eat it.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Are you screwing with any nerves?
Follow it.
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
How should I know?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Who, me?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
It lends you an air of mystery.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
No. What will you do.
You found her.
Where are you going?
Don't worry!
Neither can they.
No. You can't trust her.
Probably.
Cash.
While he makes the run.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Now, you're too suspicious.
Oh no!
Yeah, sure.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Don't give her your name.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
It's a long story.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Surveilliance on them all.
We met on the beach.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Well what?
Oh yeah, thanks...
The little man in my...  ...head...
Whatever it is, don't do it.
What did you say?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
No. No one to speak of.
...right here too.
Like there's someone else here.
I am sort of scattered.
That you're not crazy.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
...Naw. Made that up.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why?
Why?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
What?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
Now what?
He told me what to do.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
What about the others.
It'l be alright.
It doesn't hurt.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Monday.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Good.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
What caliber is my gun?
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Come again?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
No, thank you.
Yes.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
What are you and Mike going to do?
Get some perspective, Lowell.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Hardly new news.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
What I've seen... I've liked.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
No.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I'll call them, Lowell.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I don't know what to do.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
ABC...?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You try and have a good time.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Most certainly.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
When should we do this?
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
-- and we are sure...
No...
Why in God's name would I want...?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
He's the wrong man.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
What do you mean, was.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
What is your husband's profession?
Why would you be here?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
Marylin! Listen to me.
But why him?
Okay Miles.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
She didn't love you?
Your mother was.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I have a watch.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
It's okay Joe.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
She did a Harriman.
Do you know him?
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
My client has ruled that out.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And she has...?
No. You're not.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yeah.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Stunt?
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He's marvelous!
I don't know.
No, I'll go through with it.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Yes, of course.
Thanks.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Huh?
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like what?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
But what!
was so scaredthat it scared
I hate the horrid stuff.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
What happened?
What'd you give him for the car?
A black eye. 
Darling!
Why not?
Same to you.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Get out!
Oh, excuse me. 
Don't accept any more.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
I'd put you there myself.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Well, I'll be
Yeah, where am I?
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Five G'sor I crab the works.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
And Oswald?
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Keep saying what?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
I did.
Why?
Dave?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
What about Ruby?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
A Willie O'Keefe?
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Take a look across the street.
What are you driving at, boss?
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
You know who the mayor was?
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Are they?  Why would they?
Yes.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
...and your General?
Ever ask him?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Was he there often?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
I know. That's why I went.
You were there for me.
Three years.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
I can't believe you do me this way.
And you didn't tell the Police?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Take your time.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Yeah.
It looks nice.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
You're not old. You look great.
It's not really something I think about.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
I don't care.
They seem to like the idea.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
You think he's got a thing for you?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
What's he doing?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
You'll get over that.
Madrid or Barcelona?
What for?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
I never have. It's not my money.
Uh-huh.
I thought you were watching him.
Gimme one anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
You already knew that?
Keep it between us girls?
You betcha.
Yeah.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Can you cover that?
I can do that.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
She don't know shit about the money.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
I can sit through it once.
Uh-huh.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
Sure.
Uh-huh?
...and just take it from him.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
C'mon in.
That was Beaumont.
So we on the same page then?
Yep.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You couldn't just hit her?
Fuck you for asking me that.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Have fun.
They don't have your winning personality.
Gonna have to put up cash.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Ten thousand sounds high.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Well, give it to me then.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
She's all alone.
You sure?
You know it's for you.
You're hurting me!
What do you want from me?
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
It's hard to explain.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
It was the window.
Tell your mother.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Used you?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What else did he say, Jake?
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
I saw Sarah the other day.
Who?
She talk about the boys?
You should go back to her.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
No.  I see them.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
I'm not cold.
It's not healthy with it closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
Jezzie, I can't see.
Yeah, but for what?
Not to me.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
When was the last time I said a word?
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Where?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Get your clothes off!
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
What?
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
What? What do you mean?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Are you out of your mind?
Stick with me, kid.
You've lived with me for two years.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
The Ladder?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
I don't know.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
If you're lucky.
Total delirium.
Push 'em back.
Please come quietly.
Total delirium.
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
I need to see you, Jake.
Count 'em on one hand.
What's wrong?
Why not?
You've seen them?
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
How did it happen?
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Rizzo did.
Get out of here!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
You got that right.
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Hey!!
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Not so bad.
I'm on my way.
NO!
Just get us to the ship!
Maybe she tripped.
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
You need to get laid!
Am I in there?
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Good point.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Are you finished?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
Try some of this. I made it myself.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Michael! Come inside!
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
You going to be all right?
I don't know if I can do that without a...
Maybe we can save August...
Just sign it, Larry.
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
How can you tell?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Do I set the goddam hook?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
I've got all these signs here...
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
The shaft is giving.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
I don't think so.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
So that's cool with you, then?
But you copy my work every week.
Charisma?
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
We could get back together too.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Mine too.
Okay.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear it's yours?
No... I guess not.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Cool it.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Yeah.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Junk?
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
That suits you.
Uh, thanks.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Come on, I have something for you.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I'm pregnant.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Don't mock me.
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
I suppose anything's possible.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
That French ain't it?
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Yeah.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Damn right I do.
A... I gotta go.
The party?
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
...I do.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Up yours.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Why, what did he do?
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Not yet.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where would we find him?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
How long did you fuck her?
Yeah.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
How?
Yeah.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
It is right.
You down with the boost?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah.
Why I give pennies?
What are you talking about?
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Yeah probably.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
You have?
Yeah.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Am I getting warm?
Good luck.
I gotta find him.
It's like...
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
You think so?
But then I won't need your money.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
I wouldn't know.
What do you want?
Then what's he talking about?
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did you know her?
Why not?
But you said you didn't know her.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Please... wait.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Uh huh.
Of course.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
That has nothing to do with it.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
No Frank.  No prints.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
That's a big area to cover.
What does that mean?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Maybe I already have.
Answer the question.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
That's a very personal question.
Do you always open quickly?
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
I'm sorry.
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What?  By attacking me?
You've got to face the things you feel.
You really haven't seen my best side.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I can't.
I don't know how.
That way. I can feel the cold.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
You will know, in good time.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
We must enter the swamp.
I road them often in my youth.
I don't think that.
Let me comfort you.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
We have plenty of hares.
Hush!
He will not!
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
A fine match.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
Why do you want to know?
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
Well, I don't need them...
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
...17.
I think.
...Why didn't he close the window?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
It's impossible.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I've seen it before.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
What?
You don't think I love you?
Yes.
There's no reason.
Show me.
Please tell me.
You've just decided, is that right?
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Don't be so sure.
He's plastered.
Good.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
From where?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Red flag, man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
That's me.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Walking where?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
It's mine to risk.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
What are my choices?
What do you think I should get?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Are you working?
No -- S.E.R.A.
You what?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Of course.
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Yes.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Sera...
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
I believe we are.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Where you got in the shower.
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
No!
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
You think?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
What?!
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
So?
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Are you asking me on a date?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
I guess it'll have to...
Of course.
I completely agree.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
That's not entirely --
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
No.
East coast people are different.
You go where?
What, like it's that hard?
See?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Fire moat... why do that?
You go to lady now?
To finish last evening's delightful work.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Oh, yes...
Yes?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
Might we watch, too?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
And if I cannot?
Will you lead me to her?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Whatever for?
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Blackheart?
Jack, don't!
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
There's the way, mates.
We'll find it.
The chill is worse this night.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
You're on your own... like a true champion.
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Three cheers for our champion.
Never.
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
What's the matter?
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Tis the truth.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
What?
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Biting you?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
What became of the princess?
Is she fair, this princess?
Only that?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Are you his friend?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Where to?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Why are you so stupid?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Not if what he left me was real.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe that's too long.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
To check up on me?
Mom...please.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Oh, okay.
Did you got through my pants?
The gloves on the table are for you.
I know parts of who you are.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
What's wrong with your back?
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Here.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Because Dad left?
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
I was parked in day parking.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
I'm married.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Sam's favorite.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Going on?
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
A man he respects.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
I never asked for more.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
No, nigger.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
But you can't.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Yeah...
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Take care of me?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
Yes, sir.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Why didn't you take it?
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
A loan officer?
My daddy gave me this watch.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
What'd you say?
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
So?
You know what I'm saying.
Forget it.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
You drew this?!
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
I'm stuck!
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
Say what?
I don't know. Who do you want?
I can't eat it with mustard.
What am I gonna eat?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You ever done time before?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Movin' it out, boss.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
What were they, bootleggers?
Just like Elvis.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Are you offering me a bribe?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Don't do it!
Urr... uggg... errr...
Try an angel.
An angel?
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Well, let's rock and roll.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
How bad?
You got it.
Beast.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
What was it called, sir.
Dude. Seriously?
You smell like coconuts.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
The South.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
All right -- what are you?
From? From? From?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
It has nothing to do with you.
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Please... No.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I changed my mind.
And now?
How a Sandman lives.
I'm afraid to tell you.
You're sure you don't want to try?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
You know.
You know something.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
What do you need?
That's nice.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I -- I can't.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
And Sanctuary?
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Yes...
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Oh, my...
Can you make it back?
Sure, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
Maid? Relative?
Right... This just glided along.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Or not so recently?
Hi.
Me, too.
We should stop seeing each other.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Okay. Thanks.
No.
Out in back.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
We'll get a tail put on him.
Yeah, Mack?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
What about yesterday?
He won't give his name.
A headache?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Tone deaf.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Which would you choose?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Okay.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Oh, I see.
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Is it?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Just call me Barney.
Horns?
Horns? What kind of horns?
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Think of it! In times like these.
How do you do?
buy and sell?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Very often.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Shall we have another?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Pardon me
Are you so certain you are away from it?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Yes.
Are you the High Lama?
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants  and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Why - I'm sorry - but I
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
What's she got to do with it?
was saying
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
I'm so glad.
Struggling, why?
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
No. just peace on Earth.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Don't worry about it.
Sir, you can't just--
You heard me.  You two, especially.
She didn't even know you. .
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
We're rising.
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
All of it?
Do his job.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Actually... I don't know.
Are you sure you don't?
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Can you see the balloon man?
He'll turn around.
Anderton, leave.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Right.  I know --
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
... Graveyard shift.
The nation votes this week...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Tuck in your shirt.
I'm fine, Lamar.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
I show a cop on horseback.
The mall?
Did he close the front door?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Oh... Hi, John.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
So?
What the hell.
Oh, Sean --
Hold your breath, Dad...
No.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
You look great.
I don't know who that is.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Yes.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
I wanna kill my boss.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
Yes.
He's not here now, is he?
That was our apartment.
Yes.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
You sure? I just made it.
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
See you later.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
He's great, right. Is he great?
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah.
She'll be out in a minute.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Why?
Pshhh...
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yeah.
What drill?
Good morning.
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
What are you saying?
Don't be shitty.
I got no idea.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
I gotta pick up the baby.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Well, I don't want to walk.
This is bullshit, man.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Back in.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Fine.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
What about it?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Cool.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where do you live?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Goodbye.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
What?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Bet you are.
You never had it.
Now.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
She ate.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Why do you ask?
Are you?
Did you hear what I said?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Let me do it then.
Allah Akbar.
Now you come back.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
I do know I love you.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
No. You'll be marked for death.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I ain't doing bad.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Might be all right.
He told you that?
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
I don't know shit about you.
I have connections.
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Who ordered it?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[And?]
[And I had my men ready.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
I'm here.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Yes or no?
Creasy...
I'm looking for potential.
That's right.
No.
Where?
I don't understand.
Yes.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
Frank. Frankie.
Then be trained.
Be a swimmer.
So are you.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Because...  I was already dead.
Planned what?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Hmm?
Creasy.
It's not.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
You helped him get this job.
What makes you say that?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Down there. That little one there.
What for?
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
What happen?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
I'd like that very much.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'm just here with another girl.
I'll see you around.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
About eight o'clock.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
You gonna get married.
You not ugly.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know. I don't think so.
You want a beer, Ang'?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
How you, Radar?
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
The chest-cutter.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Yeah, if I can.
We're a good team.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I found a doner.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
An eternal damnation.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
What's the story?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
I have not understood what you means.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
Yes, Colonel.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
I used to throw the javelin.
I out-coached that General Hammond.
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Nice.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
You got me.
No.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
What's that?
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
What John Doe?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
John Doe.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Yeah, a little.
Where is she?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Both of 'em?
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Sure. Mostly often.
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Yeah, you bet!
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
What difference does that make?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
I didn't see anything.
I don't know.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
I'll take half of your action.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
Is there a problem?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Is that all?
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
Where did you hear that?
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
It's against my nature.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
Still needs work.
We won.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Greg.
Can I come in?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
If you did, you never showed it.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
...Let me just show you.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
SHIT!
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Yes, I believe he has --
Okay...
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
About what?
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Yes...
Dream?!
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
The weather.
Go!
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
He wouldn't say.
Good question.
Tanner.
No.
-- You told me.
-- The inside?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
There was no other choice.
Resurrection.
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
Zordon...  he's gone.
There should be a way to open it.
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
A stellar idea, Skull.
There's enough for everybody!
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
How about Major Moron?
Quack like a'duck!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
And I ain't no nigger either!
Awwh, Charlie.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
But ya got a Boss.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Tell me about it.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
You scare me, Charlie.
And now you have everything.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
You got men on Profaci's place?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Like a party for all our friends.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Who?
Come off it, Bugs.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
He's trying to make it.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Didn't know you felt that way.
They do what I tell 'em.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Shuddup.
You wouldn't live out the week.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Uhh - martini?
Stu Miley.
Well - you'd need a body.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
How much?
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
...In some weird way I respect that.
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<i></i> In what way?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I'm good.
I don't want to talk about it.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
... Manly?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Thanks very much, sonny--
But it *isn't*?
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
No!
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Yeah.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
No.
Okay--I mean--
No--not offhand--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
What is it?
Taylor, my dear.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Henry Hill.
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
The--head?
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
I yield.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Mr. President--
Fine--
Certainly would, Joseph.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
And with your help--
Oh, just a day--
Why?
Calendar?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
We're over in the House.
Have you always had to--work?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Terrible, thank you.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
I know. It's--Violet.
No! Stop it!
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
No--
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Not another bill?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Saunders--!
But--I've done everything I--
Where do we go from here?
A camp! Well!
Then you *did* say it.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Swell!
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
That's right.
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
No.
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
You are , aren't you?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Don't be ridiculous.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Uh-huh.
Had the boys follow us.
Yes.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Gold, eh?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Shut up!
Why, it's an artistic institution
Me?!
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
No, I mean - about my client.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Now wait a minute, buddy
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Not at all.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Oh, I do too, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
You try it.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Were you supposed to have a session?
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Not any more.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Are we?
Why? I'm paying for this.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
What?
Oh?
What?
I'd better get in there.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
You're on your own today, honey.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Really? What would it take?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And he's where?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Um-huh.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
What do you want me to see?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
I wondered what happened to her...
That's all right. What's on your mind?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
I can tell you anything else.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
No... no training.
What'd I do?
What?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Relax, I got him.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Altar boys?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Immune from what?
Intestines.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Exactly --
Try me.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
And what did he say?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I would never!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Fifty percent.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Oh that's comforting.
You dream about dead guys?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
I think you were jealous
Got what?
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Awfully.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
I know you knew I'd know.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
I can't.
Or even what it looks like.
How's your dad?
Ummm.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Date?
Who wouldn't?
I'm going inside.
And what if you get killed?
Yes.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
SO WHAT?
Why not?
See ya tomorrow.
Come on.
No.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
The who?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Right.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
What do you mean?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
You realize what is at stake?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
But who made this treaty?
And where is Joseph?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Come in.
Thank you, sir.
You may go, Captain Charles.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
The first reports came in at about ten.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
What is that?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
That is correct.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I see.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Oh, yes... of course.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
I know of no better time.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?
No.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
She must have been in love with you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Open the door.  It's me.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Yes!!
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Why did you give it to him?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
What?
What was there to tell?
Yes.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Let me have it.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
That's it?
And I can go free?
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Y'all never use it?
I don't know!
I'm gone.
Not me.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
What you mean, so?
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
What about me?
Hold on.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Nothing.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
Call me.
I got fired too.
I don't know the number.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Business or pleasure?
Oh, yeah?
Who did?
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
For not believing you.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You...
Tell me why he's dead.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
Okay...
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Right.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
It doesn't look like it.
Shut up.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
What gives?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
I been mindin' Pearl.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
She went.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
So you ain't with the State no more?
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
I'll be switched!...
All to pieces!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Fiddlesticks!
What?
'Cause you're too little.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Dead. 
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Come on, children!
I don't know nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Under the stone in the floor.
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
Naturally.
Because John said I mustn't.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Hi.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
Just want to talk to him a second.
To bed with you, c'mon.
Nancy?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
He's nuts about you.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
I have nothing to hide.
You should. I'll show you.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Evening gown?
What is it, Anna?
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
Yes, Comrade?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
The former Duchess!
No, sir.
No, sir.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
That's perfect!
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
It is Thursday!
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
I'll send you a muff.
Two thousand francs.
A week?
A day.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Look for yourselves.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
That's even better.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
What business?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Yes!
I must get into that country of yours!
What for... why?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You might hold this for me.
Love to.
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Then how did you get here?
On which boat?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
You see? Life can be so simple.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
And General Savitzky.
Our salute will be a kiss.
Much happier.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask what has happened?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
At Pre Mathieu's.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Pay him.
Why not?
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
... go on.
I don't have a pistol.
Sir, the deadline is today.
And if I stay?
Lincoln used it.
I don't know anything about that.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
What's Liddy got?
What do you mean, sir?
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
You never told him?
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Yes, Mother ...
I expect more from thee, Richard.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
Thou must.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Mr. Castro.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
No.
Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
Winning?
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
The old queen did it on purpose.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Of them.
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
It's hard to lose ...
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
It's over, Dick.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
And then you'll be happy?
Then I'll be there for you.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
And what am I doing?
No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
He won't neither. He never has.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Mm.
So when was he here?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Yessir.
Don't get hurt.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I put it in, Mama.
Well I didn't see it.
You gave your word?
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
I need to know that.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Uh-huh.
What did you tell him?
You go to hell.
Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Nobody. Accounting.
With anything?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
You've lived here all your life?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
November the 28th, last year.
Well enough.
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
Another additional.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
No, one forty-two.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
No I don't have it.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
I don't know.
Are you in the service?
Nam?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Anyway, so what?
You're lying!
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
...to see you.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
You knew Del?!
Yes, she is.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
What's so special about it?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Roy! What are you doing here?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Worse.
I came for love. My fianc is here.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
I was talking about what you could wear!
Who?
Umm...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
A doctor on the show... why?
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Oh, five years, give or take.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
"Injuns?"
Hmm?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Did Chloe crack?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Okay, Everett.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Oh, okay.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Suckin' away.
Helluva awgazation.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Now Penny, stop that!
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You -
So I borrowed it till I did know!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Great.
What for?
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
It's important, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
How're you doing, Sarge?
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I haven't made up my mind.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
He didn't give you much choice.
Be a friend. Leave.
I've never had a girl.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
I can't risk it.
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
But she expects you to marry her?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
There is not one thing funny here.
She better.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
You're an idiot.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Shut up.
And we're never getting in.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
The hell we are.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Well, I know that now.
What do they want?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Yeah.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
I don't know, why?
YOU HAVE TO!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Stop it.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah.
I got you.
Yeah... whatever you say.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
So talk...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
I'm down.
I don't know about that.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Yeah.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
What?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.
I expect to try.
Pride will do.
He's my father.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Of course, I do.
Who cared for your wounds?
That one is a bit more difficult.
Yes, sir.
Are you going to meet with him?
How can we end this madness?
God help us all when you're forty.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
It's Mister Marion.
Name five hundred.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Yes.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Not at all.
What's at the end of it?
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Then come on.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Wouldn't wash?
Nope. He's your cat now.
And because the dead walked.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It's beautiful!
Good d--
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
She.  Goes.  Free.
We got that part.  Anything else?
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
Very well.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
I know where your heart truly lies.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Yes, father.
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Ceremony?
If I had known --
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
You would do that?
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
Agreed!
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
You haven't seen it.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
... no.
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
He may be.
Still --
Until he's done.
No.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
Maybe you should, but you can't.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
The trunk.
Thank you, sir.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
I want Trix!  Mommy!
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Right.  You predicted it.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Mouse?  What mouse?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Daniel!
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
That was 'simple'?
What about it!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Probably the caffeine.
That's going to fit me?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
God, what a fight that was.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Don't worry, four eyes.
Exactly.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
You're all right.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
Now let's get this settled
I know that.
Gallagher!
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Oh, man!
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Oh, is that so?
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah, little Gloria.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
What play?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Dawson, sir.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Hello, Joe.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
They've been ready for the last half hour.
With pleasure, Madame!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Yeah.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
She's crying.
She's crying.
No she's not.
Trust me ...
So.
It's better, Mary Sue.
What's the matter?
But it could happen.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Rain.
Okay--that's enough!
What do you mean!?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Yes.
The other one?
Pleasantville Marathon?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
YOU get lost!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Hunh.
I don't think so.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Not directly anyhow ...
The pages filled in?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
What?
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Real rain?
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Look ...
... Only if they mean it.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Yeah ...
Christmastime.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
TV repair?
Yeah ...
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Cool.
Cool.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
This is "Fly With Us?"
Ok. Thank you.
Somewhere in Utah.
So you're coming tonight, right?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
So it's ok if I bring her.
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Why?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Do you like porno movies?
No.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
It doesn't matter.
Georgia.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
I know I did. But I don't.
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
No.
They're not open yet?
They don't get opened until eight.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Yeah, not really.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Yeah?
Yeah, no, I see --
So that was your pudding?
Nothing.
Really?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.
I thought that you were anyway.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
Did you do it?
How?
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
Barry Egan.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I'll say whatever I want --
I think you have a call?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Why you wearin' a suit?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
You're goin' on a trip?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Are you serious with this?
Nothing.
What time are you gonna be there?
I'm serious.
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Yeah.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Just tell him to call me.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
And --?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
What on earth would that require?
Go to hell!
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
Of course.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
And his writing?
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
Yes?
And place my reputation at stake?
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
Oh indeed?
That's not our intent --
You'd suffer in her stead?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
No. But tell him I would.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
No, when I was but a tender lad--
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
He needs me here.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Bel Air is restricted.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
You will not walk out on me
I will not have this in my home.
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
You are talking to him.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
What are movies about?
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Who the hell's Manolete?
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Oh Christ
Please don't say this.
Don't do this
Don't do this
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
Listen to me-
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
The title?
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Uh huh.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Hedy Lamarr?
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Thank you-
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Very generous
Yes
Pardon?
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Jesus
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
For what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Believe what you want.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
Here's your glove.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Except fall down like a normal person.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
What?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Whadda ya mean?
Whatsa matter with you?
Does that mean...
At night?
It feels real good.
Jake...
Do what I say.
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
What did I say?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Jake...
I took the kids to my sister's.
You did?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I dunno.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Excuse me for living.
It don't look right.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
You think he's getting out of here?
A possibility.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
It's me.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
No.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
I don't want to.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
How did you know!
Depends one which one.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Police?
There's something buried there.
There's probably one in the basement.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I have one now.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What is it you're looking for?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Yeah.
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
What's the apartment house number?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Not yet!
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
A new disease.
I'm cute, too.
Stay there.
Jim Stark.
Glad to meet you.
Okay.
We got to do something.  Don't we?
Down in back.
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
No.
What would you do, Dad?
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
I was in it.
I don't want to learn that!
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
He's just loaded, honey.
That's right!
He's home.  I heard the car.
Look--just relax, will you?
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
No.  It's okay.
Come out come out wherever you are!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Your father!
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Here.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
Why?
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
And you wanted him to make a list!
Wash up and go home.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
And your folks didn't understand?
See?
Who lives?
Oh.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
No.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
I'm getting that way, too.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
Why?
It is for me too.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Hi.
That one?
What?
We were romantic then too--
Gabriel, what are you doing!
To all those cons...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
He'll be dead when he does.
Radio said negative five.
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.
No, no --
Saw me --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
JESUS CHRIST!
You're not hearing me here --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
What?
You shouldn't have.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
Who wouldn't.
No --
I never told you my name.
But you were saying you were...
Yes!
No. It's her brother.
I'm gonna need some money.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
How'd you know my name.
I don't know... what you're...
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Merlin, I didn't know --
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Good for you. Protein.
GUARD!!!
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
You gave them me.
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
Who the hell made this map.
Now where were we?
You're coming back to work for us, right?
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
I'll call somebody.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
...What bar?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
What for?
How many employees?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
That's your proof?
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Don't ask me that.
Your name's Freddy something.
Freddy Newendyke.
I do.  How do I look?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
As opposed to good?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
A few cops.
What do you think?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I don't know anybody.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
He asked.
If we don't, he'll die.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Not these guys.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
You can stay here if you like.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I hope so, too.
Why do you think?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
I'm sorry.
It's going to Sonora.
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
A little hot.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
At the ranch maybe?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Yeah, it does.
I don't care what she asked you.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Nobody asked you to.
Don't act so -- crazy.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Maybe in Sonora.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
I don't know -- I don't know.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
If you need me, I'll be --
I found a picture of his wife.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
Okay.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Hugh Kane.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Huh?
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
You could use the grade, huh?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Are you?
What are you getting at, Professor?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Just a little Rogaine.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Okay, give me my belt.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Then let us prepare.
"Fucked me."
Don't worry, I got your back.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
I certainly did not.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Let me see!
I'm so happy I could shit.
This is so silly. 
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Shhhh..
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Yes, I did.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Who is this?
COCKSUCKER! 
I didn't do it!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
You got your wish.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Right here!
You forgot something...
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
I'll give you fifty cents.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I can't understand it at all.
Nothing.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
What did she want to know?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
But I'm not joking.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
I won't get lonely.
But you're always at the library.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
I keep telling myself that.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Perhaps
It might have.
I don't know.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
Why
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
False alarm.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Younger.
How do you mean?
Why is that?
Agreed.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Nothing I can't finish later.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Who's Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Yes.
Yes, I do.
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
I have money.
It won't. Are you ready?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Her name was Elizabeth.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Subtlety?
Interesting analogy.
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
I ate by myself.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I'm not either!!
You bitch. I knew it.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
So it was recently that you tried this.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Yes.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Do you have to say that?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You touched him?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Did you take your clothes off?
So will you, someday.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
And you ask questions, right?
How long will it take?
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
When I was fourteen.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I can't talk you into it?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Could be risky.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
I want to see you.
Right now.
Cynthia. John.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Right.
No.
It won't. I trust him.
You trust him.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Who?
Graham.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
No.
Goddamit...
Brian Kirkland, please.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
We live in 703.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
It's crazy.
That you, Rog?
I don't get it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
A wreck.
Fools!
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Yes, Betty.
Shove it, Ralph!
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
Who?
It's...
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
No...couldn't I do this later?
Fabulous!
YOU'RE NO GOOD
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
How's the trip?
What are you pouring tonight?
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
I am one of those guys.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
What color is it supposed to be?
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
When do we get to drink it?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Pour us a couple.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Bathroom.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
You're an asshole.
Shut up.
You have to tell me --
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
What's that?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Hold on.
She got anything good?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Yeah, same here.
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
A paper?
What about me?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Miles?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
So how're you doing?
About four weeks.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
My ballet recital.
Hi baby.
Clear for what?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Explain noises.
You want him coming in the house next time?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Ray Reddy's house.
They already know we're here.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm close.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Me too.
Sorry.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Why not?
They'll find a way in.
It was my fault.
Did it seem short to you?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Where were you?
Where's Jake?
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
That's why I'm here.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
That I do.
I expect.
He is that.
What happened?
Who?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
He is now.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
Really?
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Because they enjoy it.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Luck, I guess.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with it?
Give me some of the good stuff.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
The picture's dead.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Viktor, it's my studio.
She'll drive herself.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Better late than never.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
I do?
When is she coming over?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Where are you?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Just a minute.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone?
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
Hello, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
How did the wall get there?
I was misquoted.
-- We call them "vactors".
What's that?
This week anyhow.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Night, Lainey.
Really?  Too bad.
I know.  Thank her for me.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
-- I bet you have.
Er,... good.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
My God, you've got one?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Taller, Viktor.
Yes.
You could play the lead.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
-- What you don't understand --
--Do I know you?
Don't step in the horse manure.
Thanks.
Dr. Crowe.
You mean aneurysm.
Dr. Crowe.
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Yes.
You weren't a paper champion.
Are you wigging out?
You believe now?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
I know.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Tramp.
I happen to be a professional.
Which street corner?
No shit.
I thought you said two hundred.
Manure... is life.
"And a slash-slash there --"
Come out, come out wherever you are!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Pardon?
I --
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
He's right. You were behind.
Chicken sandwich?
About what?
Name something.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
It's you. You and your father.
Like what?
Like your guitar break.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Okay.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Shut up.
How many you need?
All the rib eyes?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Grant, no!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
Shoot.
He's after us again!
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Why are we doing this?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Redneck heaven.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
Let's boogie.
Yeah, but...
That's the point, Dickey.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
That's correct.
-- so you shut them off?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
No.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
Mmm-hmm.
Two of 'em?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
You think so?
Yeah, why.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
Okay.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Look at the collar on that coat...
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
What were you doin' here anyway?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Fuck you.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Security's locking down the elevators.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
You fucking bastard...
He'll let me in.
How long can you go without sleep?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
Human beings can die.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
What plan?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Book?
Rheya.  Not here.
What do you mean?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
He has a point.
Those are dreams.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
I'm disgusting.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
It's an experiment.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
You didn't like him?
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
There's a phone in the car.
Listen, that was my fault.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
No kidding.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
So it was "love".
Claire...!
Oh that thing in Queens.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Pretty bad.
I know.
I know.
Mike...?
You're planning to speak?
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
What?
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
She's got to identify him.
I might stop you.
I had to follow her to a store.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I'm sorry.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Is she injured?
Why should she come in?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Yeah, I think so.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
What, want a glass?
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I'm always here, Pete.
See?
Harry!
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Even if they're not clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Huh?
Thank God.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
What?
Does it have a human name?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Precise equipment such as waldos
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I left a paper in my desk.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
What?
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Looks good outside.
We'll get some more.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
A little something what?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Not you.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Betty Grable!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
It's not good for you, Animal.
Do Jimmy Durante!
It's that song, Harry!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Any objections, men?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You off your rocker?
Shoot!
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Thirty-fifth.
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
A chicken?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
HoS qorDu. 
Where is he?
Thanks for pointing that out.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
What do you mean?
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
It's our pleasure.
No, no. Thank you.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Phasing? To where?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
No, sir.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Scotty...?
Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
... Fascinating.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I still don't...
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Sir...?
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
What's wrong?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Yes. And I know you.
Count on our help, sir.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!

Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Then, how --
What must I do?
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Yes, my lord!
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
All true.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Our first order of business is survival.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Mother, go back!
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
What's the matter -- ?
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
What?
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Is that what you came here to say?
Don't you believe it.
They're still running with shields down.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
They just don't want us going in there.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Dismiss the company.
Try again.
Aye, sir.
I do this because I was there,
It'll come back to him.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
That's crazy!
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Come on, Pavel...
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Then how.?
Well nobody's perfect...
I was not informed about observers.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
I am? May I go now?
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Can you protect us?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Iowa.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
So. There we are.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
But you said toxic.
Yes.
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Yes, sir.
Put them on screen!
On screen.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
The explosive override -- ?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
You will be in good hands here.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Millions?
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Right on. You fly?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
They are my friends.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
There are days.
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
You're what?
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Won't he rust?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
I believe it is safe, sir.
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
A planet in Federation space...
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
I'll be in Engineering.
Eject the core.
On screen.
How long 'til they reach us?
Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
Are you saying they won't help us?
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
No... no, please... you cannot...
I believe so.
Where's the Sphere?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
What makes you say that?
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
I am not a thief...
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Aye, sir.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Just a little queasy...
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
The charge is murder.
That's the question -
Can you - ?
I didn't mean this future.
Specifically of...?
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
We were until your torpedoes!
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
That's a comfort...
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
I checked the data banks, yes.
Yes.
Yes...
Who else?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
He's got it.
And your coat.
Krandog aranty.
Except us.
Where do we come in?
Captain.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
So, that's it..
Why would they give them to us?
I SHOULD have been -
... is to trust him.
WE SURRENDER.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
What?
You having hearing problems, mister?
What is it?
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
I know precisely where he'll be.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Aye, aye, sir.
What exactly does that mean?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
Why?
I know.
No.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Good work. The download?
It'll only work for one of us.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Divert power and compensate.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Do you have a name, sir?
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Not with the Romulans.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
A coup d'etat?
She's a predator.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
And the Senate supports you?
I have dissolved the Senate.
I know.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
I have no reason to.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I see more than what you are.
But you want to.
On my way.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
It is... invigorating.
Runs in the family.
Should I raise shields?
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Find her again.
A matter of hours now.
They're holding position.
I don't think so... 
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
It is beautiful.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Neither did I.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Steering wheel.
Police...
Good.
Smile... good?
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Shit?
I...
You want to try it?
Yes.
No.
Do you have a baby?
What is hitchhike?
The car will stop?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
Why?
On the radio they say it's good.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
I can't stay on this planet.
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
No.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I did.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
It could have been anything.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
No problem.
Watch and see.
He has his uses too.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
No.  Mace is in this.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Talk to me about costs, here.
What?  Right Here?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
He records himself raping and killing her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Okay... what about Strickland?
That's pretty much the way it happened.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Who was just here?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I already got everything I need from you.
Your sex life?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
She's my destiny.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
I'm not going.
No, it's not.
Uh unh.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Yeah.  See you there.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
The diner?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I'm on my way.
Let's take a look.
What?
She's buried.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I have 6 tons.
Yeah.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
What?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Go ahead.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
"Was?"
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
I was visiting an old college friend.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
They're all criminals?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
He thinks he looks young.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
You did.
Oh.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Suspect Zero.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Yeah, of course.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Kulok.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
Zero killed them all?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
You knew it was me all along?
It was the mall.
Those were just fantasies.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Yeah.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
I want to help you.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
You're money, baby.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
...and even then...
I'm a "Dorothy".
Could you believe it?
Why not?
It's a rebound.
Me too.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
...Which one...?
What kind of things?
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
You don't call.
It sucks.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
I mean, I need the money.
I don't talk about her that much.
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Darwinism at its best.
There's the rub.
I didn't make it...
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Sure.
He's trying to be an actor.
You asshole.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
I know, but...
Always.
She smiled, baby.
You think so?
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I don't know...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
No!
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
She was hot.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
...a day...
He drives a carriage.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Yeah. You met him once.
She didn't notice.
...How novel.
What was cold about it?
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Good.  He never doubted you.
And what is that Bonasera?
The Court gave you justice.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Yeah.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
No, just you and Paulie.
Sure.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
Now you've had your drink.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
How?
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
How do you know I come from America?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Okay.  One minute.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Yes.  Tell me.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
I love you.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Oh Michael.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
Send some bodyguards.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
I do wish to be baptized.
Be patient.
He talked to you?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Sure. Any time.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
I don't like you.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I love jazz.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
And Rome.
You're breaking my ribs!
Copy out from here...
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I love Marge.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Have you done something to your hair?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Such as?
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Sure.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie did it.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Oh Marge.
Do you know Tom?
I hope so.
Excuse me?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the...?
I've never admitted that to anyone.
You're kidding.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
Where have you been since then?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Hmm. C'e questa... 
And tomorrow?
Do you want me to stick around?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Nothing.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
I have!
Absolutely.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Yes?
The moon?
I know. I could have picked you up.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Kris Kristofferson.
Huh?
Thank you, Travis.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
With the other hand, right?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Iris.
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Do they drug you?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
That's not hard to do.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
There must be something...
I know. I tried that.
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Things got ya down?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Yeah.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
I'm a field agent.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Whatever happens.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
You mean,  me?
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Oh.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Well, then, as what did you go?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Thanks.
You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Dad, I...
Ha!
I know, I know... keep still.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Sandra Sinclair.
Then I'll call you a cab.
No, sir.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
You should watch what you say.
It's wrong, Leo.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Of course.
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
I already have.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Cathy?
Actually, it's none of my business.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Yes.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then what was it?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
She already has a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Mom, they're in a cage!
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Is she all right?
Yep.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Thank you.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Mother?
We won't be here.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I started to say... inside...
You don't have to.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
That's all right.
I'm awfully sorry.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Are they moulting now?
How?
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Why... 
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Seven o'clock then.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
You were lying.
Yes.
What?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
I think I should, don't you?
Really? Tell me about it.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Take wing!
It was like that yesterday.
...everything I know.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
For what purpose?
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
Help how? What do you want to do?
Not if they're starting a war.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
I've heard of it.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But you did promise.
Yes, I suppose so.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
Don't call me that confounded name.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
Get out of here!
A pleasure to torment me?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
No great lady will ever take my place?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
I think we should get some support?
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Your father gave them to both of you.
Someone else did it.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
I don't want to see!
Erin. I'll always be with you.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Watch out!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I don't believe you.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Thank you... Have you any news?
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
What about him?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Yes--?
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
But I suppose you know the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Well, how do I know who you are?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Where's Star, David?!
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
I will, David!
How do you know they're not?
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Lots more where he came from.
Whatcha doin' over here?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll pass.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Ocean air!
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Do I look that needy?
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What about Mom?
The Marines.
Huh?...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
You promise?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
What?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
For your health.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
All in Norwegian.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Enough, MacReady!
Damn you, MacReady!
In this weather?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
A couple of hours.
After all this mess then.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Anyplace but here.
Get your gear on.
Hear what?
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
But you escaped.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
And why not?
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
What's happening to the moon?!
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Holding you... again.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
For God's Sake, David --
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
Hiding?
I live with it every minute of every day.
I can't do that --
That's absurd --
I'm glad.
Mm.
Why would you do that?
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
Learning was important?
Mara...?
I see.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
What do you mean?!
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
For our sake, I hope not.
And you've no idea where he went?
But... what about Starks?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I never touched your father! I swear!
They should just be looking harder.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Just do it.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
How'd he die?
I know.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Why?
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
I could try to...make it stop.
So it's helping?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
This has nothing to do with that.
It doesn't look all that different.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
How...how do you know?
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
So what am I supposed to do?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
I'm sorry.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
Hon?
What?
Why?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
I have no problem with that.
Right.  Where are they?
What for?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Shut up.
Thelma?  It's me.
You're a bank robber?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Who's your friend?
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Have another drink, Thelma.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Try to.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Alright, Louise!
I... I...
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Idaho?
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
I believe you.
Eeuww.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
How do you stay so positive?
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Good-looking?
Well once. Mary.
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Uh-huh.
I don't know what to say.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Who?
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Dumbshit.
Thanks.
Pat Healy.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
You're a movie buff?
-- Love story of our time.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
You can't be serious.
No, not at all.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Uh, that's okay.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
What do you mean 'why'?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
How'd you manage that one?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Who's that?
And did everything -- ?
He's dead.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
You're Woogie?
What?! No please, sir --
No, that's really unneces --
Oh God.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
So what's up?
Uh-huh.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Yes, sir.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Smoke.
Kenny. It's over.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
All right. Then I guess it's time.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
What's happened?
I'll be evacuated with the President.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
You crashed my file?
-- a fucking cop.
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Thanks, Cooch.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
He said he doesn't know.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
What do you mean?
Nothin'. Forget it.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What?
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
I could be, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
You know. The finger.
Lieutenant...
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Anything.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You always get what you want?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
Not to me.
What do you want?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir!
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Got you here.
The list is long, but distinguished.
No shit. The Iceman....
Mister to you.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
What?
I can't eject.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
I didn't ruin her.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've seen this before.
Bad?
Sir?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Then why are you here?
No bother.
I called your house.
Or....
I don't know...
It's not true.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
Why not?
And you get a kickback.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
I think my grampa might be here.
Who are you?
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
So why am I still alive?
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
At Rekall.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Rekall?
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Level 2.  Galleria.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Up!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Bye.
It was implanted by the Agency.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
Let me go!
I think it's still hungry.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Just wondering.
You can't fight'em that way...
Cannon fuse.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Me, too.
Right.
We need another plan.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Its tires are flat...
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
An hour after you picked it up!
He was your snitch.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
True.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
The hell you do. At this hour?
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Chinatown street gang.
...Are you sure we want that?
-- You found his mugshot?
-- Yeah?
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
-- Roger -- ?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
-- Me? Neither.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
No, s-sir.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Badgering.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Yeah, we do some of that.
Shu's the only one I know of...
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Yep, it sure is.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Oh.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
OK, Gordon.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
No.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
No... No...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
Hey, Jacques...
What? She asked about my father?
It does matter. We're in love.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
James...
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
Everything, but everything.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Yes.
Bobby didn't give you this?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Nothing.
Very good.
As far as we know, nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Just now...
Yes.
I...
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
I do. Yes.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
I am seventy-four years old.
Objection.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Yes!
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...and you're going to do that?
The most respected...
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Laura.
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
No, no, I'm just...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
How come you're calling me from...?
Missus...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
It's a long road that has no turning.
That's for sure, Frank.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
They still have to take it to a jury.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
The Hospital...?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Would you like some coffee, General?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
It was nearer than that.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
What?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
No, you don't.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Chase. Hi...
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Diabetes?
Is he all right?
What?
What?
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Read me some?
Seemed, not was.
Really?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
You got it.  What's happening?
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Claiming their place in the world.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
I know.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Is it true Phil?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
I can't watch this.
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
No.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Oh, really?
You're officer of the watch, George.
Why would you do that?
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
It seems we're short on singers.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
Then keep your mouth shut.
I'm not staying out here.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
It wasn't hard.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
Yessir.
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You heard from Reggie?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
What happened on the charges?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Hell, peanut...
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
So?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I do.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
How'd you know my daddy?
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
It's a comfortin' idea.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
One bad car accident...
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Let's leave here.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
No... But...
Someone's gonna see us.
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
What?...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Tripp.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
So what's the problem?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Call it a hunch.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
How long have you been having them?
I've been trying to finish a book...
She told you about...
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
'Fraid so.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
No! What gave you that idea?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Really? That's remarkable.
You're right.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Yea, James.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
What's he saying?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
That's a big book you're writing.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
I never heard of it.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Kinship. And what's here?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Because of my coat?
The hell I am.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I think so... What about you?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Jesus.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Chancellor.
All right. This morning --
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
You heard? How?
Really, Sara, I...
About the baby.
Are you sure you parked it there?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I... I...
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Sick.
Her husband.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
No, the dog.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
K through sixth.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I like the noise.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
How old is Anna?
It was a beautiful present.
It wasn't like that.
The birthday party.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
There's a million birds here.
Sure.
I can't.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I'm not pretty.
Why don't you just tell me?
I would.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
It gives me headaches.
Yeah.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
They sound like finches.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Then why are you talking about this?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
What is your idea of being normal?
What's weird about that?
What about them?
How about in the morning.
I molested little girls.
Hey, I'm not --
Sounds like a special guy.
You must hate your brothers.
Not ever.
Us seeing each other.
Live together.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
That's not what I meant.
Fine.
You're such an asshole.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Who else?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
No.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But you just said that a month was too...
This one is gorgeous.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
And why do you tell us this only now?
Yes, very much so.
Then I'll go with you.
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Okay. In a few minutes.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Tell me once more.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
What do you think?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
Here I am.
I appeal to you more?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
You know, I don't love anybody.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
She'd punish me.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
It made them holy.
What do you mean?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
For what?
Who?
Right now?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
At least once a week.
And what happened?
Anything.
Why not?
Why do you smoke?
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Do you?
She'd get angry.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
And you're unhappy.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Her headaches.
Alright.
Yes.
Why?
Will she be angry?
I'm afraid.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Hm hmm.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
What else?
No.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
I don't know which one 
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
So she sent you?
Of course you do. Who was it?
For what he made me go through.
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Marty, what are you doing here?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
I can get you new evidence next week.
It's your favourite...
Yes.
Uh huh.
Yes... I...
No-one.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
Could there have been anyone else?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
The science of psychiatry.
So, someone else could have done it.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
Answers.
The sheets...
Oh, God.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
I'd love one.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Hand rolled.
Pipe!
Mary Magdelen?
Yes I do.
Listen to her singing.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
Who is he?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
She is an innocent.
Did you know she was pregnant?
That's a lie.
No!
What happened to the baby?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
The cards... you're bank.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Shurrup!
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Oh.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
A butcher?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
He hasn't.
Is he?
Sorry.
He comes from a large family.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
I'm not ...
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Why selfish?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
I'm not wrong.
What?
Have they?
What are they saying?
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Don't be callous.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
So's mine.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You wouldn't!
Well, you look like him.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Don't exaggerate.
Sorry.
Good lad, Ringo.
Down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Shurrup, cheerful.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
He can't be far.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...
Hell, we're equipped --
Or something will be able to see us.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Sure.
Take care.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Yeah!
Why, what's wrong?
What do you mean?
It grows on you.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Here, let me try.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
I'll come with you.
How's Broussard?
Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Oh... God...
I think it's fizzled out.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
Is it still dripping?
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Let's get moving with this net.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
But?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
With great pleasure.
You win.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Kablooey.
What did it do to you?
No... don't...
Sure.
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Okay, give me the numbers.
Get her on-line.  Now!
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Nooooo!
Not yet.
Deal.
But...
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
What?
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
What?
What's wrong?
It's alright, it's cool...
Auto-shop?
Compensate!
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Aren't you?
Why not?
You sat and talked until it was light...
A dull cliche.
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
What of it?
You're being childish.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
That's how you met me. In passing.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
We have that in common.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
It just slipped your mind.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Show me a human and I might have!
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Okay.
I thought you were going to be late-
For instance what?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I'm trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
A cowboy.
A married lady.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I don't have to. I want to.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Every day.
From what would I be running?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
You're quite a girl.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
The same size?
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
No.
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
I've heard of them.
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
My husband...
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
You won't forget it?
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
There are other plays...
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
I've got it.
Right here.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
How far to the station?
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
What is he talking about?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
That's beside the point.
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
When's the audition?
Are you breaking the contract?
I said I'm a dying man!
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--no way--
Yeah?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
We need a sympathetic face.
About the past year.
Facts or theory?
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Maybe we are...
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Any idea what he did?
Sure--off the record.
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
--what?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
FBI too?
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Where?
--I'm Woodward.
No.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Why is this?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Forget it.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
You can't sing at the competition.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
I know, it sucks!
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Pontificated.
Went home to shit.
Holy shit!
It's not what it looks like!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Nadia, I can't --
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You got in.
Just a second!
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
What?!  How do I do that?
You've just inherited The Bible.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Fuck yeah we will.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Uh huh.
Exactly.
Yeah. Apparently.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
It's okay. I can see fine.
What?! He told you? When?
Andy! No!
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Yeah. French fries...
Right.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Oh no... no....
Why the fuck would I do that?
I told him it wasn't ready...
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Now!
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I know, but I had to because . . .
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I'm glad you	did too.
I'll never let go!
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Bartok... a question.
What do you mean?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
I need a large polo mallet!
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
Why not?
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Alvy.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
And I love what you're wearin'.
Yeah, I know.
Well...
Okay.
Fifteen years?
Oh, yeah.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Well, who's Sadie?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Oh, I see, I see.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
What?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
U-huh.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Don't you think I do?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
It's his name.
G-go on, I'm interested.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Yeah, where is the spider?
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, darn it.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh! My God! 
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Nothing at all?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
The what?
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Oh, you got a headache!
Oswald and ghosts.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
You'll total the whole car.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Look, uh...
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I mean, I-
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
His wife has diabetes!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
No, no, no, not at all.
...of possibly working together.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
Hey-
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
And here, you just-
And how's the diva doing?
She's a constant surprise.
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
I'm in mourning.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Oh.
Well, probably.
I'd say it was down.
Don't you miss it?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Oh my God, the sitter.
It's not a contest.
Please?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Forget it, Judy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
It's ecstasy, Sal.
She left the fucking gate open.
He'll find his way back.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
That is not true.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Don't push me away.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I don't want to go tonight.
Me too.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Come on, Panes...
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Elitism?
I'll be your best friend.
Let's go for a walk.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Excuse me?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
I'm so sorry.
No, never.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
You know it's true.
What does that mean?
So tell me, how's it going?
You don't need to thank me.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I hope they're watercolors!
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Why are you doing this?
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Wanna dance?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Hlllllllp!
Stop fooling around in there.
Let's dig in!
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Superior numbers, kid!
Ant Team Six...
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
...Not enough food?
ARREST HIM!
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
What do I do?
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
Ma'am?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Care to make a small wager?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why?
Yeah.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
You're so right.
Of course not.
I don't understand --
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Someone from the office.
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Give what up?
A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Too slow?
Was he really upset when you told him?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Who'd care?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Thank you.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Over a girl?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Might as well go all the way.
Fine.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
How do you work it with the key?
I'm not through with you yet.
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Swap them? For what?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
Sir?
Oh?
Yes, sir.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Yes?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
What does he mean, accident?
Who else?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Me?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Aren't you?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night.
The party's over.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, I know.
Let me take that.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Well --
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
We need all our fuel.
I said I like all of them.
You can keep your fucking fuel --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Let's talk about you.
Fat. That's real fat.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
Why they call you that?
What are you doing out here?
Probably is.
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Yeah, I know.
You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Where ?
I'll go with him --
No shit -- hot damn --
Looks pretty shallow.
Maybe.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Terminate ?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
About what ?
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Captain?
That's right, sir.
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
What do you mean?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Don't you agree?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I met him.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
The trees, eh...
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
I think think a lie stinks.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes...
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Both of us...
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
I know.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
107  CONTINUED:
175  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
43   CONTINUED:
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
How did she..?
Why?
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
It's exactly what you meant.
Where's Corbett?
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
That's right.  You're not.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
How many do you see?

If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Any idea who could've done it?
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Get the fuck out of here.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Me. My home number is on this card.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What do you care?
Sorry.
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
My son is sick, okay?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
One baked -- one fries.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Here's the trouble with never.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
I can trust my brain.
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you...
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Uh-huh...
I just love her.  How're you doing?
I'll take care of myself --
What the heck do you mean?
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Thanks for looking after him.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Get out.
Oh, my gosh.
Thanks.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Just do your job.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
The contract was stolen.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Ten million --
Until a minute ago.
Forget it!
Electra.
What do you want to know?
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why not?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.
Why?
Why?
Several.
Where is it?
Thinking.
Why not?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
That sounds nice.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Then, we wait.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I don't believe that.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Nobody ever sees me.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
And you were drilling these holes...?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
I'm sure you will.
Why?
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
No.
Oh, God.  I see it!
A pleasure doing business with you.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
It's possible.
What do other guys do?
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
No.
American currency.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
That makes you an expert I guess.
So?
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Thought of everything haven't you.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
We're going to need it all.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
No, We aren't going to do it.
He's lying! I am.
That bad?
So I hear.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
What are you talking about?
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Yes.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Yeah, maybe.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
How about you Brutus?
What?
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
What is bail?
No, it should be over soon.
A champion of lost causes huh?
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
I'll need to make a phone call.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Maybe it is!
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
You bastard!
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
I. Don't. Dance.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
He wants to show now.
Scamming's a strong word.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
It's private.
Ambitious.
And you have to meet my father.
Don't bother!
In 76 years, me neither.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
You.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Where?
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Me.
I don't care.
I'm sick.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Ever again.
For the focuser?
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
You don't. That's the point.
You came here to give me my report card?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Are you?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
No....
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Learn anything?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
And where am I gonna be?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
What year?
Home, school, here... 
Pro! Release the rope!
The power converter...
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
Perfect...
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
What did you do to yours?
Does he bite?
You lost that one?
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Mmmmm.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Okay.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Sure.
Quit my job.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Why?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He was nervous.
I don't know.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
New Jersey?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Planet 10?
The deuce you say.  That crate!
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
It?  Who does?
This is so embarrassing...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
John Whorfin will kill us!
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Asshole probably got lost.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
No, no 
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
It's still a little early for me.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
What do you do far a living?
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back  with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
That's all right, really 
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Where there's life there's hope.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
We gotta call the police 
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
...Both maybe?
And then... well...
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
The others are being sent.
Nine days  Tuesday 
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
You two have some sick sex thing?
...Fred...
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
A couple days ago.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
I thought you quit.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
Yes.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
I quit.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
Thanks.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
No.  Come in.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
No.
Not me.
Fine.
My wife used to call me that.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
To see if he can get away with it.
She's seen everything before.
I'll convince you.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I'm writing a book.
No thank you.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Thanks.
You did.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
Not now he don't.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I don't believe it.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
I'm going with you.
I said keep it.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
And you volunteered.
I'm sure.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Do you ever get sick of it?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
Sure, ok..
I didn't see you.
I need a dealer.
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I'm not black.
Who said that?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
What's wrong with you today?
Oh yeah..
About what?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Drugs??!
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
I hadn't thought about it.
What's wrong with me?
You like your dad's paintings?
I don't eat junk food.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
My point exactly.
I need this?
Alright, thanks.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Have we?
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Yes and no...
Had one.  Didn't work.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
No.  No glass on the inside.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
All is shrill, all is blight...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
I don't.  So, no.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
I recognized the accent.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Mr. Freeze.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Umm-hmmmm.
Just the beast.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Recognition, of course.
And another name for Mystery?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Just checking, young sir.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Rinka.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
Exactly.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Excuse me.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
...Not the bat?
What?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
Excuse me.
Who is it?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
You sunk my battleship.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
I'll take you with me.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
What did you see?
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I wish you'd...
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Allie, he's not.
Not what?
There aren't hotels?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Annie, it's me.
oh dear.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
Sean Connery.
Yes?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Why thank you sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
What?
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Bunghole...
Yer late.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
You'll be rich!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
What?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
Won't?  Or can't?
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Little black party dresses?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What makes you think she likes me?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
<u>Out</u>.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
We need help.  We deserve help.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.
Step... mother.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
And live in what, our station wagon?
Yes.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's your cousin.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Why not?
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I saw some ghosts.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
Viridian?  What is...?
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Look at the tiny figures.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Thank you, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Oh. I have a message for him.
A Black man gave me the message.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Thank you, Eve.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes. I like that name very much.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. Of men and women.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Yes.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
... Yes sir - elevator!
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I've seen that done.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes. That is surprising.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
I am a very serious gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
I see...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
... Hello.
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... Would you take me on a tour?
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Right, Chief.
Oh? What?
Thank you, Colonel.
It's that serious, huh?
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
The monkey.
Seven-ish
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
Yes.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
No, really.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You're a fag or a liar.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Hello. Wendy.
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
Hush, sweetheart.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
But of course.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
One hour.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Great then.
Who needs dancing?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
What want ye, girl child?
Say the Word!
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You still know.
YES.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
You grown.
Yes ma'am.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Won't you be late for work?
Better ask Paul D.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Her who?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
What run him off? Tell me that!
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
No, You looking good.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Yes sir.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
I am the Walrus.
Walter, how--
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
I'm shomer shabbas.
Am I wrong?
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Nancy's pretty good.
Different mothers, huh?
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
In the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Yeah man.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Well yeah...I know that.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Huh...
What?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
No, but--
Theodore Herzel.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Huh?
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Easy, Dude.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
We throw the money out of the moving car!
Wooden bridge, huh?
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Uzi?
"Our" car, Walter?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
You know this!
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Call the medics, Dude.
You're a fuck, Walter!
Shit!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
A world of pain.
This is a league game, Smokey!
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
I didn't know.
For what?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Scud.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Just do it, old man.
Wait.
No, we can treat the wounds --
You're wrong.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
Who is LaMagra?
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Look closer.
How can you tell?
Like me.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
For your miracle cure?
What are you talking about?
No --
For them. But for me --
You don't have to be.
I don't believe that.
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
He is an abomination!
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
LaMagra --
You.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
Go on, I'll be fine!
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Join the club.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Think again.
Who?
Then there she blows.
What is <u>this</u>?
You don't want it though.
I don't know. Nightmare.
We've looked at half of one tape.
--bullshit!
--Cotter's--
--you should get back into bed.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I know, I know.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
The, uh, blur there.
I can't let you in.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Never would've guessed.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Ask me what I don't have.
Yeah?
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you doing with all this shit?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
No idea--goddamitt!
--I don't know.
Yeah. Me too.
<u>What</u>--
For "James?"
Anna's the witch.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
One of the printers.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
Yeah.
Shoot.
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
--it's urgent!
What happened to my Dad??
Yes.
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Abby... you all right?
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
In the trunk.
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
Remy.
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
Going out with Meurice.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
No.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Has Ray come in yet?
Right. Sorry.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Oh yeah, that's good.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Yes.
No.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
O.K.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Falling.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I asked first.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's too bad.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know. he moved away.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?
Yeah?
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
I'm really sorry.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey!!
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Okay. great!
Just some fatherly advice.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Frank!!
Be right down.
Well.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Excuse me?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
We want some grass.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
What's that?
What's the other one?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Okay.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Try the closet.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
This is not the time, Diego.
Coke.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
It would be my pleasure.
Yes.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about.
Sure.
Money.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
No.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Why are you smiling?
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
How are you doing?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I don't believe you.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Stoned?
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
The strike is a success; but ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
Sure ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
To show them to the UN, right?
Good evening, sir.
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Your witness.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Why did you come by?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Show me.
I had bypass surgery.
She was.
We stopped seeing each other.
I suggest it never happened.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Yes -- quite easy.
Where did you meet him?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
I suppose.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
P.M.
Because he called me.
You know I can't talk about that.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
I went out on the boat.
Tonight we open new doors.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You're a monster.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
No, Your Honor.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It was a place to start.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Well, I can help.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
Oh.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
I thought it was funny.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I already apologized.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Sure.
Are you hungry?
No.
I bet you could do a book.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
But now that you have it -
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
What's she like?
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Died there?  How?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Just try it.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
That place is already bad luck.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
But the place burned to the ground.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
What we have to do is call the police.
You want to get into this now?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
What are you talking about?
Where's what?
Yeah, I know.
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
All part of the business.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
All right, Caesar.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Just hurry.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Go right ahead, sir.
Another time.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
No.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Yes, it is.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Mickey?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
Johnnie?
Yeah.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Shit!  Oh shit!
Not Caesar.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Thank you.
I was so afraid you ...
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
I'm not asking.
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
I don't think so.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Get the kids out!
Sir, you waited on line.
Paris?
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
I want to go home.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
-- you could put it together --
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I was shot twice in the back.
Anytime.
Go ahead.
-- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- we'll tell them what happened --
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
So get the hell out of here.
Wait a minute --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
So now you're asking for a student visa?
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I won't forget this.
...elephoned sir.
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... new washer.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
It's reply paid.
Beginner's luck.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Not really, no.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What has Tuttle done?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Trust me.
Shut up!
What?
It's you ... it's you ...
Them?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Turn!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
What?
Oh ... Jesus!
What happened to you after ...
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Try next of kin.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
I know that.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
But ... I called Central Services.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Stressed? He's psycho.
Where is she?
Mary, we really have to go.
Got a beer?
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
I know him. That's Noel.
You never know.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
No.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
You look so different.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Five years.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
I think the worst is over.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
She's no whore, Marcus.
That's too many.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
The brakes are shot.
It's early for him.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Let me think.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
They'll just keep calling.
Yeah, you're right.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Yes.
That's your full name?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
We can cut back at the end.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
No.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
This isn't friendship.
How?
Upper management thinks you're dull.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Thanks.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Yes.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
He said something about...
Because...
No, I don't think so.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
...good-bye then.
I don't know.
How are you at back rubs?
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Uh-huh.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
What?
No.  Were you going to you?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Who?
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
What?
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
It's better when you let me say it.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
Not anymore!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
It wasn't easy.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Better!
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Carla -
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I know, man.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
Huh?
I didn't buy it I made it.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Sure!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Yeah and what would I say?
It was.
Never mind...
Huh?!!!
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Here here!
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
With Dead Cat?
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
You think?  Split?
Let me in.
Don't tread on the earth?
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Uum... around ten?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I think you've forgotten something.
Hi there.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Well, stay here tonight.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
You sure?
Mmkay.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
For the dance.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Get away from me!
Cafe Blase.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Get a boob job.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Time to do what?
In Virginia.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
She --
What?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
But you threw a knife at my head!
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
My nails.
They were vampires?
Fine.
A what?
It isn't important.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Oh.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Good.
Jeffrey!
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Hey, wait a minute...
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
You can learn to like it.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Switch nostrils?
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I think you're real cute.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I won't be needing these anymore.
We all deserve to wear white.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
What do you believe in?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
I can do that, too.
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Will that work for me?
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
I told him.
Gimme that.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
What do I gotta do?
Take the first shot at me.
Hit me in the chest with this...
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
We'll pray anyway.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
It's a league record.
Okay...
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Looking for Crash Davis.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
That's right.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
I was in the building!
What do you propose?
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Yeah.
Lester...
Okay.
I can't! I'm tied!
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
How did Nicky collect?
Hey.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
All right.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
And at the...
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
And what'd she want?
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
How'd you know I was here?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Oh, thank you, sir.
No, that's quite all right.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
Good to meet you.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
Yeah, refill'd be great.
She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
Why is she eight pounds over?
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Here we go. Good luck.
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
I'll be right back.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Thank you.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Right?
You sure?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
How serious?
Yeah.
With the money.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
And where'd you go?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I want you to let me go.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
This is not the way to treat people.
No, Sir.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Shut your mouth!
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like...
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Yeah?
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Calm down! Calm down!
I'll take care of it, Remo.
What're you gonna do?
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Ma che cazzo!
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
All right.
Am I right?
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
I don't - 
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Well, you know...
Yes.
I'm here.
Do you know that?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
It means I got the money.
No, I'm gonna drive.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
So are we.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
You're a little confused?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
There's a lot of people here.
I'm sorry.
You are right. What can I...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I wonder..
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
She has a real spirit.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Wha-at?
Even the skylight?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
I still have one left...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Nothing. How's your hand?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
You could've killed us.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
What am I supposed to do?
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Give me 20 minutes at least.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Oh won't I?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
What are you doing now?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
What bank?
The City National on San Vincente.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Do you know what's in that box?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
God, if he doesn't come back --
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
Did you hear that?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I don't want it.
Sure.
Talk to the man.
And not a nickel.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
In your dreams.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
I thought so.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Then why doesn't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
What you think?
You fucking did.
Cunt.
Charming.
Please, Dil --
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Not English.
Jimmy?
He wants me to perform for him.
You on the game?
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
They're jealous.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Must be in love to manage that.
No.
Yes.
Did you do that to him?
Are you jealous of him?
Didn't think I could.
I'm superstitious. Drink.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
Sorry.
Absolutely.
Only if you kiss me.
Not here.
You could say that.
More than that.
You'd do anything for me?
Look on it like a honeymoon.
I was trying to get out of something.
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
My pills...
It was you...
You tried.
Fergus.
Tell me what she wore.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Thirty-five.
Fergus.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Please, Dil --
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Do you now.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Suits you.
Of course. I forgot.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what if you don't?
I sincerely hope so.
You sure?
Thanks.
It's your decision.
And do you know why?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
And who is she?
Aye, I do, Peter.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
I seen your fucking face.
My pleasure.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Yeah?
Why?
Who gives a fuck.
It was fun while it lasted.
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Can you remember anything at all?
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
No!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Very sweet.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Who?
No.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
The last one, please.
Around one.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
But you're -- divorced?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Me?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
What are you doing?
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
No --
Shut the door!
I don't believe it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
Well!
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
I don't believe it.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
The money is unimportant.
Here's ten.
And if it is?
Why bother him?
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I'm very cold.
He was a wealthy man?
A letter? May I see it?
And this? And this?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
We won! We won!
How's that?
Yes.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
How do you know?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Don't you understand French?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
What was it?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
What are you talking about?
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Don't you want me to stay?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Yeah? What's that?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
That's impossible.
Calm down Brent.
I will. Is that all?
A little.
I'm not.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
You know about that too?
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
No!
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Don't you think it's sick?
Yeah.
Yeah. Who is she?
That's what he said.
Why not?
Now don't be nervous.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Told you to hide it.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Since when does...
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
For cryin' out loud.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
All right, then how about this?
You stole this truck.
Shut up.
...-ed.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
Oh!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on, old...
All right, you got it, you got it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Ho, ho...
 Oh...
 Shit. 
Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
All right, let's go.
Come on!
Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.

...-tion?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
...hospital.

...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.
You all right?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 



 That's why I didn't give it...
What?
...they come!
Forty-nine point four.

Hold this. 

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Look out.

...about him.
Three seconds.  One...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
What the hell's a sage?
He's the dude...
...including the permanently extreme.

Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Any of them Richard Long?
...to be off the island tonight.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...about--
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...always done, Richard?
Went away? 
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.

Radio the bikes.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
I wanna patch in from...
You know the suspect?
...though.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...

Dead, last time I...

You'd never understand!
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
...it.
And you ain't gonna start now.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
Kabula's out.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
I will tell you what I...

Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
He's brains without ambition...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
God!  They're gonna seal it.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.

I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...

EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
They're calling it an accident.
Oh yes.
Very.
Honest?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No.
My daughter.
Just find the girl.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Could you drive me somewhere?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Okay.
Or her name?
Let me show you something.
Yeah?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Yeah.
I guess not.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
A complete surprise?
Yes.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
What are you having?
I said I'll drop it.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
A check?
It wasn't much of a lie.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
No. I'm just a snoop.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
And Hollis knew about it?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
This morning.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Upstairs. Why?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
What did you do that for?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
She's my sister and my daughter!
To Mexico...
Back to Mexico.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
Where can we go?
With us.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
He's in the dark room.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
The obituary column?
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
When it comes.
Drowned, too.
Yeah.
Of course not.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Yes. No.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
But you don't have any kids!!!
It tastes wonderful!
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Too bad!
Why? What do you mean?
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Progress! It always arrives too late!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Hi. Why are you running?
For what?
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
You never used to do that!
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Enthusiastic?
Certainly not.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.

Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Emily -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Emily, you -
It's - all over -
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
No.  But you're close.
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Half past eleven.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Susan, I really think -
Susan!
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Charlie -
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Am I sure?
You're shittin' me.
You think I'm shitting you...
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Very dramatic, I thought.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
You don't have anything to do with it.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
Sang.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Call the police.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
So?
Bunch of savages in this town.
No, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's cheating?
What do you mean?
Oh, my God.
That girl was vile to you.
Allan Harris.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
You know what I just watched?
Blasphemy.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
So?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
She's in here?
Perfect dozen.
I guess not.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
The milkmaids?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
At least we're stuck here together.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
We're not playing in the street.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Bible truth.
No!
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
You know.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
May I be blunt with you?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
And this is what you rented?
Really?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
What time did we go to the funeral?
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
I was born.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Get the fuck outta here already.
They are not.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Yeah?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
With you? I don't think so.
So.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Lasagne.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
No, he got hit by a bus.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Really?
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
How many girls have you slept with?
It better be up to and including me.
You've only had sex with three different people?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
HOW MANY?
Lower your voice!
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
A few?
What're you talking about?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
I don't want to go back with her...
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
It stings a little.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
No way.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Feel that.
Yeah!
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
That's sick, Dante.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I'm not sad.
Which one?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Would you?
Is it really four thousand?
That's it, you look like a professional.
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Where've you been?
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I don't expect you to understand.
And I can't leave.
For the same reason you did, to help.
Remember the first time we came up here?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Do it, goddammit!
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Then go fetch.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
And you, sir?
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
No. She's dead!
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
What would you like to know, sir?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
What crime did you commit.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
What job and how much?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Keeping fit then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Brown hair, is it?
Fine... fine.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Yes!!!
Just part of hospital routine.
Yes?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Carry on, Chief.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You got a deal.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Yeah.
Where are you, what floor?
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
This isn't our goddamn game!
Vincent...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Oh.  Sorry.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You prefer nights?
You mean like benefits?
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
I'm trying...
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
She's in the hospital.
Jazz.
What happened?
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
Slow down.
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Just drop me off.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Yeah.  I think so.
Do they have a secret handshake?
Surprise me.
Pretty scary, huh?
Uh huh.
Who are you, Jerry?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Is he dead?
Not this again.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Realized what?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Connecticut.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I can't promise you anything.
Top pocket...  Go on.
That's great.  Good for you.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
Well, I don't know if --
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Excuse me?
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I don't understand.
Night after that?
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
I don't think so.
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
A third layer.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
You want to classify prime numbers?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
That's my scientist.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
So who...?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
Now... you go home.
That isn't the way it works.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
I didn't realize I was out.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
That's what they all say.
Sounds like a Russian general.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
You sonofabitch.
Peter.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Make that two.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Now you know.
Prove it.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I don't follow.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
But --
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
We work down in the ditch?
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I don't know, Boss.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Hey, Tattoo!
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
I call.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
A cold drink? Okay?
That's it. That's the end.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Like an elephant.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Like I always do?
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Fear of what...
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
You're calling me a crank?
Who?
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
They all have one...
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Over here.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Look at him, grandstanding...
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Talk to Nikko...!
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Because I think I'm wrong.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
You messed with the evidence.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
One of my suitors.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
You're kidding.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I want to see my mother immediately.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I don't want to hear anymore.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Truly.
What's the matter?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
It's good exercise, Mom.
I've already made arrangements.
Yeah?
Lie?
I guess so. I think that's right.
By color.
Who do you think you are?
I wasn't hungry.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Guess.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
How about a dance?
What?
I guess so.
And all the plans we have.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Sure. Of course.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
So, I've been thinking a lot...
So will you?
I love him.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
They don't have a murder weapon?
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
It's me...
Marcel?
You're calling me on is phone?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Good.   I'm good.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I'm not here to negotiate.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Cops?
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I'm from Belgium.
We had a deal.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Great fuckin' song.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Go where?   The police are outside.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Yeah, I can see that.
You lived there. You know the city.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
Get in the car.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You see that car?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
I know where she went.
J&amp;B?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
A little?
Wait!  I'm a friend!
What's it to you?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
Don't bother.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I have a guest.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
What do you think?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
Never!
Then you have no use for the sword.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I will.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Fine.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
What was it?
No, not yet...
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
What about you?
Shu Lien...
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
No.  I have one more thing to do.
You're welcome.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Does she have a name?
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
I can see her.
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
The night is young.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
From who?
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
On my mother's life.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Great book.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Give me the fucking letter.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Oh please.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
That's not fair.
Sure.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Schwarz. Jewish?
Any ideas who it could be?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I don't think that bothered him.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Those are my letters!
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
That's great.
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Did you hide the letters?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Best friends.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
I swear.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
No, you were fine.
I do.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Care to make a wager on that?
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Cecile.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Yeah.
So? How'd it go last night?
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
War it is.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Absolutely.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Yes, darling.
The Farren house
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
But it's already come true.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
That's right.
You're shouting at me.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
I suppose so.
But I told her to go with you.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
I'll show you.
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Why didn't you run after them?
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
But where is that?
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
I shall wear it in my hair!
It stands so still.
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Mommy read it to ne.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Good.
Look at me.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
Now, I don't know Amy --
And Amy mailed them?
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Can we get some service here?
Yeah but they looked cool...
At Victoria's Secret.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
And she got the medium.
George bit you?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
What the hell is the tampon test?
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
You're just saying that.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
DON'T call the police.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
You're such a good friend.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
About Benito.
Frida? You okay?
Sure. See ya.
They say sex is great for cramps.
No.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Okay, you busted me.
A man killed in Central Park.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They do? Oh no...
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Peter I love you too but...
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
No, take it.
Tell her I'm eating.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Did we get those DNA tests back?
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
The other one?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
You are mistaken.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
You wont regret this, sir.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Where does it lead?
It must be a closet or something.
Wait, this isn't fair...
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
No more than the usual.
The usual...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Alan
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Share...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
Just don't call him, Alan!
Exactly. A condition.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Don't do this.
Dave -- I'm working.
And who's gonna find out?
So what do we do?
That'd be great.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Oh my gosh...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
I don't think so.
What?
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Why?
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
I had a feeling.
The Vice-President...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You made their funding disappear!
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
But you could go to jail for it.
It was inspirational.
I can't.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
It's nice.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
What?
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
What you wanna do?
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Well?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
I'll tell you later.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Sure.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
A barbaric yawp.
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Where is this cave he's talking about?
That's miles.
Todd Anderson.
I don't.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
what?
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
I saved your life is what I did!
Who asked you to!
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
He's with them.
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
Keep tasting...
No...
I don't take orders at all.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
What the hell does that mean?
Fucking women, man...
Nick's going?
No women?
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Jesus, it's freezing!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
But I insist.
I came to see Merle.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Nick, she won't say why.
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Biederman!
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
Sure.
What kind of beer would you like?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
What?
I don't know.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Yeah.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Pow.
What else?
I'm doing that too.
What do you mean?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
You didn't get a deer?
Phantom Mary?
Sure.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
What'cha got, Bennett?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
I'd think about it.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I'll be alright.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
I'm ready.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Pass.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Thanks.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
No, sir.
Not yet.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
I'm signing off.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
What's your name?
Hi.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Of course I will.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Young man -- you got me there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
All right, darling.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Sure am.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
I don't care.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Well, I --
Shall we?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Jabez --
Oh -- Jabez.
Jabez!
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
Me -- a son.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Let him try it.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
I'll be there, too!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Why don't you?
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
It's okay, it's okay.
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Only if New Jersey counts.
I'm a cop from New York.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
I told you...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Two?  Are you sure?
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Listen.
Come on, what's under this?
Okay.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
So... that sure is something.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Who's this?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I'm not alone.
I got Sal.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
You tryin' to fuck me?
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
I took too long.
Well, they go to guard school.
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
I don't fool around with you.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Why not?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
What about Howard?
Hey.  It's raining.
Did you always call him Junior.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You're serious!
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
Bullshit!
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
I speak what I feel.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
We can't stay here.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Did Pop come down?
You're news, Sonny ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Of course not ...

How come you ain't got no brothers up?
No, you the man.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
I've done that before.
My name is Eddie.
I'm working.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Sal's gonna be mad.
I'll see ya there.
What are you so worked up about?
Nice!
You are too crude.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.

Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Actually we have something for you.
Yeah. How'd you know?
HARRY Dunne.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Ooh gross.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
I'm fine.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
I know I am, Mom.
Home school. Til today.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Why not?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Exactly! A pirate!
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
You're not my real dad.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Sucks for you.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
I kinda screwed things up.
You're always your harshest critic.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.

That's what Jessica was talking about!
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.

And you are great in bed.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
Everything. Just for the record.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.

That's good.  I could use the money.
Of course!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
Mmph?  Where am I?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
This is the big moment...!
Will he be okay?
What?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
I understand you just moved here?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
Isn't he dead?
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Bela died.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Who's Dr. Tom?
C'mon!  Let's just go.
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
What's uncanny?
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
So how long have you known Eddie?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if--you're vomiting?
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Sure.
Ed, do you want my advice?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Oh.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Our what?
Our foibles, our foibles!
Dynamite is dangerous.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
I missed you.
No. Who?
Look at this.
Somewhere.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Great.
We'd better go...
I know.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
That's the point -- this could change things.
Tu
pierdes.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
What kind of person?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You guys have fun?
Dick.
So nice
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
Yeah?
Ethics are...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Sure
I'm looking at new cars.
Good for you.  Good for you
Doing what?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Door was open.
You're there.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
I also like bananas.
What...?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
People can see this.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Thought what?
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, get out!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
Till 19-fucking-70.
That obvious, huh?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
You fuck for money.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
How what, Wendell?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
Yeah.  A great big one.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
No.
Until he gunned down six people.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
But you were business associates?
And what?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Get on it.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
You make a mistake?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What are you talking about?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
I like it!  I like it!
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
Where'd you hear that?
Yeah.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Yeah.  Me neither.
Oh Jesus.
What'd he give to you?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Clear as day.
I'm doing a transfer now.
I don't know what that means.
I'll pay you.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
Move it.
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
How'd you have the manpower to--
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
The NSA killed him.
Who?
Those are Feds.
Oh my God...
Fuckin-A.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
No he won't.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
Well then who can?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Thanks.  Who are you?
Than why can't you tell me.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Right.
I've seen it.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
What happened to your head?
That's okay.
You did good.
Why the hell would I--
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
It's not?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
What answer were you--
We're screwed.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
We believe he did.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Alright!
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Christ!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Calm down.
Are you okay?
What does that have to do with you?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Get it.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.
Get it.
He's clever. He had help.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
No sir.
If they've looked at the video.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Do you have visual?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
No.
Excuse me.
As the wife of one of our party.
Her or me?
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
No, but I think I do.
When were you least happy?
You will.  You will.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Do you have your papers, sir?
What?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
May God make safety your companion.
Shut-up!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
You were in Africa?
Fine.  I'm not looking.
Where've you been?
I liberated it.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Moose.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Candaules
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Thank you.  Thank you.
Really?  That's sudden.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
Why?  Is he staying?
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I'm not sewing anything else.
No!

Yes.  Later.
It's what I've learned.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Yessir.
I don't think so.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
You got a better idea?
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
How close?
I don't know, but close.
I'm in the middle.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
It's sold.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
So alive.
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
Nice spot.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
That's because I wanted them to!
Try laps. Say a hundred.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
Hold the record. Alone.
My job, my rules.
Transfer.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You've thought of everything.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
You know where my loyalties lie.
You're giving them to me?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
What do you think?  What's this?
It's those files you asked for.
All of 'em?
All of them.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Jesus.
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Course I did.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
I know how DNA works, Erin --
And that's what caused the contamination?
No --
Yeah, I heard that one before.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
No one's taking anything --
I did.  Both.
Here what comes?
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Take it.
Yesterday.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
And ...?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
You got more than one?
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
Keep your voice down.
I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.
What do you want, a joke?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
What's going on?
What?
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
Everyone's invited, of course.
What's wrong with him?
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Because of my father, I guess.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Yes.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
That should do nicely.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Thanks to you.
Repairs ...
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
I'm sorry too.
Luke?  I don't get it.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
You may call me Leia.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
Let's go.
Me too.  I was afraid.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
What's in there?
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
It won't get through the blockade.
We know that.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
He's a gorilla.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Go on now. Do as I say.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
I thought he was, but he came back.
What?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
What's in it for me?
Say goodnight, Carjack.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
No.
I'm here.
Does he know how to activate it?
I said pull over.
Right over there.
Yeah, kinda.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Like hell I do.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
Thank God.
Who ain't?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
I cannot--
--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
It is deep...
Thank you.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
He has given up.
We are to blame.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
I didn't know that.
I see, your excellency.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Me too.
May I ask...?
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Never mind.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Why the math?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
He didn't mention?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
To begin with it could make things worse.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
In Europe.
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
You think?
I wouldn't talk.
I don't know
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Damien Karras.
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
That's good.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
And also with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Unlikely.
Yes.
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You're not going to drive.
Yeah, come on in.
Baker.
My brother and I. One each.
Oh.
Accident?
Go fuck yourself.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Two nights.
Am I late?
Count it.
Jack...
Count the fucking money, Frank.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Cindy.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You gotta go.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
What was it like?
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Okay.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
What?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
How come I didn't hear anything?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
You're making things up, Frank.
What's it for?
What?
Shut up, Frank.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Yeah, fine.
She asked for it.
Spur of the moment.
So what'd you think?
The audience was a little off tonight.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
You're an hour and a half late.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
What's wrong with it?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Maybe.  I'll call him.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Tell her.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Forget it.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
And you don't?
Pretty much.
I suppose.
His kid's sick.
Hey, business is business.
Just dinner and dance, right?
You were good.
Friend.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Long story.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
I guess it's getting serious.
Wow.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Oh, fine.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
He hit a guard.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
What do you mean?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Shoot him!
You mean like ... condoms?
What?
You can't blame me for trying.
Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
The hospital.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
What about me?
I dont think youre hearing me.
Mom liked it.
I dont think so.
Its not Kate, is it?
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...
No.
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
What?!
Cmon, Jack...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
It would help me if we were.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Yeah...fine.
And...?
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
How would you look at it?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
What...?
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
And now...?
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
Its wonderful...
What are you talking about, Jack?
Jack.
Paris?
To Paris. Paris, France.
Thats the one...
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
Jesus, Jack...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
Aspen.
Not by a long shot.
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Do I know you?
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
I'd like that, too.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I'm taking the train...
Five times.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Go back to the drawing board.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
What do you mean "complete"?
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Then what is it?
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Front page?
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Hilarious.
Ben did this.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
We need to get past them.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
And take a little trip with them...
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
And if it should take more time to get through --
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
Yes...
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
It's too late!
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
It's possible --
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Yeah.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Uh-huh - in what way?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Oh, yah?
Yeah!
Yah, real good.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah!
Yah.
It's okay, Scotty.
Okay.
You told me about it.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Well, that's okay, I just -
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Aw, Norm.
No, that's okay.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Well, they're a good outfit.
I'm sorry.
No, I didn't...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Margie Olmstead?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
...Mike Yanagita!
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Linda.
The day of our homicides.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Three-cent stamp.
Yah, I guess.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Dynamite?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
The girl had done her homework.
Look, this is a bad time...
What the hell are you doing here?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
It was the smart move on her part.
Hear what?
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
What?
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
What do you want me to do?
...no ...no ...
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Hum.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Yeah, I'm sure.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Homework assignment.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
I don't know!  Tell me!
This isn't possible...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
I quit.
Defuse the bomb?
Why what?
I swear on my life, I won't...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Too much school.
What list?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
So let's do it.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Speed up.
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Yeah, you should have specified.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Who is this guy, anyway?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
"It?"
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Design?
You have a responsibility to tell me.
No.
What's that?
You stopped.
Home on my strobe.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
American?
You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
How much we got left in that minigun?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
That's an order.
We just take pictures?
Black.  No sugar.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
American.  Come to get you out.
I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Yeah.
Well, there's nobody special!
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Really?
Yeah!
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
And who's Lydia?
See, I told you!
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
No, it's not... Come here...
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
No... it's just...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
Tragedy?
I... I was just leaving.
Yes... I... I agree...
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
No... thanks... Listen --
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Him...?
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
It's a classic.
Who are you talking to Jack?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
In a bar called Hellfire.
What are the other reasons?
You advise us!
OWW...MAN...
Got any Ethel Merman?
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
No.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Out where?
I did, didn' I, El?
No.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
I don't, huh?
No, let's go...
Who?
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Five'll do it.
No. We have tomatoes.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
It's not that bad.
Where's Catherine?!
I was really very moved by the way you...
No, it isn't what I think.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
What?
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Perhaps...
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Is it true?
What are you doin' here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
Of course.
So what's her name?
I kissed those girls.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
She fucks it all up!
Pitt.
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
You sure?
How do I know you're not lying.
Not really.
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
You're kidding.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
Not a prayer.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Two bs?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Well, which one?
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
No idea at all?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
Nothing. They're still there.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Oh, about ten days ago.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
No problem.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Why not?
Because we can't.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Alan Stanwyk.
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
That's right.
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
Don't say shoot, okay.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Cute thing.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I ordered lunch.
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
What about his parents?
Long story.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
What does all this mean?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
You saw a forgery.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Don't tell me I can't --
In her cabana, sir.
I recommend it.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
I commend him on his choice.
This morning.
I don't know.  Look!
Practically.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
I have some ideas.
Print this Frank.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
What...
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
Yeah.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't know, I never met your father.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Nuthin'.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Have what?
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Right away!
Exactly.
You're saying you need money.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
I like.
Who?
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Fluck you!
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ye-ah.
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
Forget it.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
I'm off it!
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Are you okay?
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Only on a first name basis.
Hey, the poet...
Don't forget anchovies. 
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
It's your problem.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Who financed it?
Fake it.
Des Moines.
Morning.  Sometime.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Drink this.
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Come on -- just for fun --
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I can't.
Pass.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Baltimore?
One way to find out.
You alright?
Did he?
Sure.
Do you know how much I love you?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
The future guy?
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
How's that?
Get him home safe.
Glad to hear that.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What'd you just say?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
29-years ago.
What?
What if it's not...
I don't know.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I think I'm losing you.
But you're not...you're not still here.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Yeah, you betcha.
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
Better.
Huh?
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
Chuck... look.
Be a man, man.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
You're the boss.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I just want you to like me.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
'Cause it stinks.
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
I'm kind of busy right now...
You food'll be right out.
Not so bad, today.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Good night, beautiful.
Get up!
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Tell me.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Until I hear the truth.
I didn't kill her!
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Really?
You're joking, right?
Yeah.
Ask me in about five minutes.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
This is Jason's fault!
Don't be ridiculous!
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I heard you weren't coming.
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
Ruptured steam pipe.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
I don't want to hear about it.
Quietly effective.
She wants a divorce.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
That's awful.
Do we care?
You say we go?
Don't wait Efor me.
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
What?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
What else?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
Two-all after six.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
This could be it!
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
I want to believe.
Because faith is rewarded.
This could be it!
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Why?
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
So do I. Over and over.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Yes.
I haven't come to you.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
Stop!
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Did they take your clothes?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
We must end the campaign.
A great deal.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Very well.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Grudges?
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
Something's not right.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
We can't stay here.
In a corridor.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Again?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
How the hell did you get here.
Antonio, the choir...
I hope he's not just a body.
What exactly is wrong?
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'll take care of my end.
News said two persons killed.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
You were asleep.
That doesn't hurt.
At least you were outside.
Bullshit.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Sure?
You bastard...
Do you mean that?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Like what?
I did I killed a man.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I'll be ready.
So what?
Who was it?
Yeah... I guess it does.
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Might try that.
Suit yourself.
Where we go in1?
What's it to you?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
How about twenty thousand?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Go with God.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do?  Albert?
Yes. I told him.
'Good.'
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Was the steering faulty?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
Why?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Confidential, like.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Yes, I do.
Yes.
No, do you really?
Was he?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
No. I didn't know that.
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Nowt.
Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
It's not like that, luv.
It never is.
Definitely.
You sure?
My brother, Frank.
No, you won't.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What you going to do?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Uh-huh.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Making a living.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Still got your sense of humour.
Scotch, please.
Nasty way to go.
The gun he means.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Ha.
That's right.
Mmm...
Well, I think I had one once.
You did?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
Eh?
I, I...I...
I...
That's right?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
What hard part?
You build it!
Yes.
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
He'd give me a job.
Why?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I do?
How ya doing?
Yes.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
It's a waste of time.
He said he filed...
No.
Where were you?
No.
You have nothing to hide.
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
That's great.
In school.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
Go to lunch, will you...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me, sir...
Who are you?
Are you talking to me?
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
I'm out.
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
Somebody broke in.
Did you tell 'em my sale?
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Excuse me...
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
What sales?
You did?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Last night, this morning.
Fuck her...
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
...yes...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
I wanted to speak with you about...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Kenilworth.
Did I...?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Why did she do that, Jim?
To change our minds.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
And the check is...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You did that?
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
I'm going home.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
I have the stuff from last year's...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Just a few days.
Some day you will.
I'm not hungry.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
Michael...
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
Not for strangers; for my country.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
Let's go.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
...Who?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
What is it?  Can I help?
We have time.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
He's an Italian?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
He's not the same as when I met him.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
Why didn't someone tell me!
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I can't let him down.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I took care of it.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
They can come in now.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Twenty-five this time.
No questions.
Tom, what do I do now?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
This meeting is adjourned.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Does it feel like a boy?
Why too late?
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
No.
I deny his every charge.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Good.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
How much more a month?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
You mean us?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
You're sure of that?
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
We have his note.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
It's new.
Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
All right, I guess.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
I don't like to talk about that.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
You first.
Not me.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Do I have any other choice?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I see.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
What happened?
You're planning a trip?
Your friend?
Don't move.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Oh Clayton.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Ooooh.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Then take the pills.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
I don't mind.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
Get out of here, then. Now.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
okay ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
We're partners here --
You mean the poor --
Peugot convertible ...
You know where the others are?
There's no one left ...
oh.
We'll take it...
What do you say, Toby?,
You all right -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
Shadow games ...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
Come here -
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
And here I am...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I take out my slim-jim...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
She does have one thing you don't.
He's gotten involved --
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
Excuse me --
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I'm in construction.
The bag with the envelopes.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
I can't do it anymore.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
I got scared.
What?
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
Nah.
He heard.
You're some fucking jerk.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
So do I.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
Please?
Oh shit.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Fuck you.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Why didn't you yoke him?
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
How you doin'?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Shut up.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
You want us to give you cash right now?
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
That's one aspect of what we do.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
Somethin's in my room.
I think so.
--Half-red, half-black--
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Hey, how you doin'?
Bullshit.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Pleasure to meet you.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
I got your card.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
I live right around the corner.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
He's not you!
Me too.
I don't know. India maybe.
Why there?
Never been.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
You think so?
What is?
Watch your mouth.
No.
Why thank you.
So Christ, call her up.
Yeah.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Here's my number.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Sure.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Bullshit.
I swear to God.
No.
Exactly.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Clearly.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Just for fun?
Like me?
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
No.
I want you to come with me.
I know. I just do.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
I never cared about that.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
What'd he look like again?
Short fella. Pale face.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Okay. Go on.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
What's it to you?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Women?
Kids?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Joad. Tom Joad.
That's the way it is.
Why, you're the preacher!
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Just around that next bend.
They never wrote you nothing?
No. They wasn't people to write.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
Women is always tar'd.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
California.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
No'm.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Pa! Shh!
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Ya say we're acrost?
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
There, them stripy ones.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Won't they come out here?
Me an' you both.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Won't they ketch us?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Morning.
We can pick anything.
Oh... really?
--Stop it--
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Never better.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Yes.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Right.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I'm staying here.
Other people can't.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
You know where I live?
It's only natural....
Up on the right.
Thank you, no.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
I get it.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They blame you for the compromise.
See you next week.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Paul?
You're leaving me hanging here...
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
See you in ten years.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You lived in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Oh yes. I forgot.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
OK. I'll stop talking then.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Why?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I don't care.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
What?... Oh baby...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
Doing what?
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I'm not pretending anything!
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
What do you mean?
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Oh, I don't know...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
They fired you?
You don't seem to upset?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Well, of course, right...
I understand, but Annie, please...
- See, what you can do for him --...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Of course not.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I don't have all day.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I want to see Pilgrim.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
You think it's cool?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
That's far out!
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Yeah?
Yeah, mom?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
What did we learn in school today?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
And unpack.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
No, you're not in my class.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
I'm trying to help you.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Joey, Joey...
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
This morning.
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady! Come with us.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Yes, sir.
It's okay..it's okay.
Why not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
Four plus Myers.
I do.
Like a sister?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
You bet.
No.
Dad, what's going on?
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Okay, bye.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Got it Ben.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Now you understand?
You blame everything on kids.
Saving the treats for Bob?
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Sure, see you later.
I wasn't spooked.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Thanks.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Yes, you can.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Is that all you say?
YEAH?
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
Exactly what do you need?
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
Okay. Later.
There WAS.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
I saw him...
I'm scared...
I'm wasting time.
Are there any special instructions?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
You're joking.
No, he called late last night.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, great.
Oh, Elliot!
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
I'm...all right.
How-how's Frederick?
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
I can't say anything!
I almost didn't.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
No.
Leave me alone, can you?!
How can we be happy?
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Stop accusing me!
Yes!
Doesn't she look pretty?
Oh...
Like what?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Huh?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Thanks, thanks.
That's a beauty!
Go right over there.
Football!
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
True.
No, no, we decided!
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Easily.
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Oh, what do they know?
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
Hmm!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
It was a terrible evening.
Really?
Oh.  Oh.
Yeah.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, well.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Hi.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Uh-huh.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
Orderly.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Then who's buying it?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
And why is it a vacant exercise?
That's what <u>you</u> think...
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
That's right.
What's new onna street?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...would you excuse me...?
...are they hard to get?
Not with any certainty we...
...are you alright, sir...?
Seen what, sir..?
Have the child taken to bed.
No.  And...
What reaction?
Yes, I did.
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
...what'm I looking at...?
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
I'm an orphan.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Well, perhaps sometime we...
That, that was <u>business</u>...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
My scar is a war-wound.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
...yes, yes, yes...
Where do you live?
No. 
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Indeed we were.
...which of us is free...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...and that is what you need to expand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
For approval.
Yes.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
I don't understand.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Yes.
...yes...?
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Say Hi for me.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Why do you even like me?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Don't think.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
What are you doing here?!
Color me nauseous.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
No.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Give it up girl!
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
You're not funny.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Did not.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
You know what I want, babe?
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
What now?
I'm not hungry.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
steps back.
What does old Stew want?
Saint Mario!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
What was it?
I understand... I won't-
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
I quit. Today's my last day.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
No please make yourself at home.
We're all here for you Trevor.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
What do you mean?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
It's getting hot in here.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Try stupid.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
LaPlante!
The bathroom!  For two days?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
How recently?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
You mean John Bubber?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Nothin'.
I...
Turn that thing off.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
Uh, no.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's "cynical"?
Hello, Mister Wallace.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
What about?
So this really does the trick, eh?
What toys do you have?
And the rent is okay?
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
Just show me the way.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
It's a living.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
I'm thirsty.
Uh huh.
Why are you mad at each other?
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Here, take this out to the table.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
Philip!  The senior partner?
That's not the case.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
I didn't.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
This ties in with Nash.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
It's late.
Who are you?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Maybe myself.
As friends -- always as friends.
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
What worries you?
No.  What am I to do?
You always get to go first.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Why don't you tell me.
Why not?
How did you know that?
You?
Get out.
Why?
And this?
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
No.  The money, please.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
I understand.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Give up.
We're trapped in a house.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
It won't be a problem.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
I still see that boy's eyes.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Shh, they'll hear you!
I can't go without Thomas.
How can we get out?
Keep your head down.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Go, Chief.
Go.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
How about you and your sister?
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
What do you want?
These disks . . . where are they?
Of course.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
What's happening?
Where is she?
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
The high command? Our high command?
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I led no massacres.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
This goes out live?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Call, sir?
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
Of course.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Please, be quiet.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
They know you are Tutsi!
Where are you hurt, son?
Get in.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
It will do just fine.
What about us?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Go out! Where?
No, no.
Tell me what it was.
A Volkswagen.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
You have taken business class?
How much beer?
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Who is this Simon?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
I'm moved beyond words.
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Is she alright?
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Did it work?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What?
Take the gun.
Prove it.
I'm better than that.
There's always exceptions.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
It'll have to do.
Run.
I don't do groups.
Haven't they already?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
You're hurting me.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
Steven??
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
-- my loss --
Good way to get your head blown off.
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Blackburn's dead.
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- ten.
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
What will they tell you?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
That poor little girl.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
What about all my other stuff?
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
The place is pretty dusty.
Must be...
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
What?
No...  NO!
Maura.
Oh, that's nice...
May I come in?
What!
Come back to us honey!
And you...are?
Good night.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
Yes, they are.
And what would you do?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Then tell me what to do.
Right.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Did you know him?
Taken what?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
What do you want?
Really?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Never, why do you ask?
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
Million five, lover...
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Adenoids?
Yeah.
Muncie!
The couch, please.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Please! Norville!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Let me look.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
You know, on farm route 17.
Every year?
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Phony, huh?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
He grins wolfishly.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
But, buddy, you were --
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Yeah?
No, sir.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She's looking for her mark.
Maybe he's wise.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Ti-Joseph?
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
I've never heard of a cure.
Yes -- on the boat.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
It'll wait.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
I've never given it much thought.
I love Fort Holland.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
What about her?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
You think I --
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
That this was going to be a key party?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
I'm not.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
We're not going anywhere.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
All right.
Ben--
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
But what?
It was all junk!
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
A key party?
Let me.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Now you are being rude.
Where you going?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Good thinking Marge.
No one.
I'm chewing.
Her name's Libbets.
What time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
And?
I have plans.
Hey Sandy.
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
Actually...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Yeah.  All over.
That must have been awful for you.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
How do you mean?
Seven years.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
Habit.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Huh?
The other guy?
Ran like hell to go to him...
She didn't tell me.
My arm!
Told you I could write an ending.
But we work so well together...
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Who made us what we are?
Then there is nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Yes... My God...
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
Is this my birthday?
Does it?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
What plans?
We forgive each other then?
What have you done?
Sit still. It's not finished -
Don't mock, Claudia...
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
How devilishly clever.
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
I want a woman.
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Fascination...
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
That and more.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
You have it...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
You loved your wife, surely.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What the hell would you call this?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
The guy looks dead.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Some.
They never found the body.
I've got to see.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Who?
I'm fine.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Well, I'm in school and --
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
He leave you?
The rest of us see bathrobes.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
I'll go find him.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
In case you do so, would you --
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Good winds and bad winds!
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was - perhaps it was.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Thank you.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Thea?
Oh, now  now look here 
I can't understand that.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Well, all right . . .
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Yeah, very funny.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
That's the kid.
Yes, but what happened to George?
Yes, but George . . .
Splendid! Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
I know. I know.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Hi, Bert.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Uh-huh.
No charge.
All in . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Hmmm?
Oh, George!
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
Very funny. Very funny.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Where are you going?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Some other time, George.
They're not my children.
All right, sir.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Well, I don't.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Didn't you tell her?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
To keep from being an old maid.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Sure, sure I am.
You going to the lighthouse?
Well, I don't know....
I'm supposed to.
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
I think we're changing course a little.
Shut up.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
We'll take your supercargo.
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
If there is, develop it!
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Got it.
You want to come here a minute?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
You said something about a camera.
Me neither.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Do you?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
So there's one around here.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
I did, I did.
Home it is.
So's a donut.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Do you?
That's great.
Because of today?  The beach?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Going out.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
What's daddy doing?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Me neither.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
What's that mean?
Anything.  Anything.
What the hell is it?
I love it.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Not tonight.
I want to go with you!
Oh, shit.
With those camera lights and...
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
Till this opens, not our wedding.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
See you later.
No.
That we swim.
Up.
Make up your mind.
Are you coming...?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
After what happened to us?
Here.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Thank you.
No, you're not.
... Me, too.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
No,  I'm not going through there.
So tell Calvin.
Hydrophobia...
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
... Okay.
Me.
But you --
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
As always.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
It's disappeared.
No, South Georgia.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Five hundred yards.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
But you always let me....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
We need beer....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Thea was attacked by a shark....
It went away....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Spent it all on beer....
You're silly....
Who's coming?
Mother....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
Good.
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
No one does till they learn....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
The plane's turning....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You'll be sorry.
I borrow it without telling him....
I'm sorry...I....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
What's that....?
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
We'll pass around cigars....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
I didn't do it on purpose....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Half don't...Bring her about....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
How come only me?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
Mom....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
It'll work....
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
No way....
Jake.
In a few minutes....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
What do you mean, Ross?
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Pay me, and I shut up.
You want me to stop the car?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
What d'you mean, "bits."
You ain't going in alone?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Three or four.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
No.
No.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Why does he want to kill me?
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
What was she like?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
One of the accountants.
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Well, no you didn't --
-- stop --
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Wait.  What do you mean?
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
You think so?
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Sure --
Don't worry about it, boss.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Fine, I just --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
You want...
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I think we made a mistake here.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thank you.
We decided to stay with you.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Very much.
Huh?
No, I air-dry.
Rod, get on the camel.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
No.
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
No, you're --
Why not --
Fine.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
To the pools?
Pleasure.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Can you be quiet?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
No, Dr. Grant says...
What did you say!
He could have died.
Here!
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
Not if it can't dig.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
KEEP GOING!
Raptors, mostly.
My favorite.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Back out! Move!
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
It certainly does.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Good lad.
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
Oh, my God.
No.
Where's Kelly?
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
What's that?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Where's Ian?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
What now?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
The monitors are failing.
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Six weeks?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Look.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
- - and swallows fresh ones.
No, no, no!
The other car!
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Yeah.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
You got me.
Nope.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Why?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
I know.
Fine.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Please!
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Excellent.
Really? How much?
Ken, we've been through this...
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
His camera... it's still recording.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Yes -- that's us.
Have you worked here long?
-- Small.
Just what you've published.
An empty tomb?
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
It's my last and final one.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
Have you looked?
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
He was murdered.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
It's not too bad working here.
Ludwig?
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
You're the animals - all of you!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Compassion.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
I do not love him.
Don't belong?
Do you always have to repeat?
No.
Yes indeed.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Mm.
No, I'm look --
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
No thanks.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
When?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Yup.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
With Trina.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
I am.
Well there's a couple --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
I wanted to give it to you first.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
Yeah.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
On earth.
Wow!  French toast, really?
I guess...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
I'm sorry.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
You're no bargain either, pal.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
It's my name too.
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
What?
Yes...How's Billy?
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Ted, do you love him?
What?
Only can I still see him?
She'll be back...
Do you?
I don't believe you.
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
But it's not a year from now, is it?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Any prospects?
Look, Ted, all I--
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
What?
Tell me.
Can I do anything I want?
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
We did not.
I pooped.
Do I have money?
It is an island. American territory.
Tell me.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
Yes.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
No, Holiness.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
I see that.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Thank you.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
We're ready.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Nothing's real.
They could try to tranq him on land.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
I heard something.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Well...
He's floating.  Take it home.
You wanna ride in my truck?
Good thinking.
So does he.
I'll take it!
<u>We</u>?
Was he swallowed?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Kevin, hey.
A jerk.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Why does she keep repeating the name?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Sometimes.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
I understand.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I think we may be, yes.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Not yet.
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
What would it take?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
I think so.
May I see your credentials?
Maybe they'll catch up.
No, I came because we need -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
And the questionnaire...?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
I never thought about it.
I don't know. Is it?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Did you breast-feed her?
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Can we rest soon?
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
You knew them.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
That is the truth!
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
Your enemy...
Will you men help us stop the French?
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
You forget yourself!
And what is that?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
All right...
Roger.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Do it.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
Two hundred meters.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
I'm not touching you!
Right.
Hardly.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Can I help?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
All right, furry muff.
Furry muff, let's go.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
I mean it's fucking empty.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Nick the Greek.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
That isn't true.
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
I-I can do the job, sir.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Sergeant?
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
He swore by it.  What?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
I'm not picking it up.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Do I seem jumpy?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
If it's too late--
That guy who got shot--
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's still pissed off about it.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Something like that.
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Masons been around a long while.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
Substance abuse?
Appreciate it, sir.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
And people make their choice--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
You have somebody else out there?
We have a daughter.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Right.
I haven't been out here for a while.
No.
Bledso
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Buddy Deeds--
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
If you spent a little more time training them--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Right. When he was killed.
You ever play one of these?
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
What do you think?
How come?
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
They've got me. Different thing.
More, I hope.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
I'm going over to the other side.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
So when did Buddy leave?
Payne.
Uh-huh.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
How much?
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
How?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
Death.
Don't.
Why did you wait so long?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
Harry.
That's my business. Harry.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
It was more than that, I think.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Nothing?
Hang on!
...yes?
Harry-?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
No.  I'm not going near him.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Heaven and Hell?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Then what do you want?
Philip Swann?
Are you sure?
What for?
Yeah, I know.
Yes.
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
They'll never find out.
How the fuck do you do that?
You didn't try hard enough.
Try.
Swann?
Who's not?
Why would I want to?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Hi, Charlie.
No way.
No, its easy.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh.
No one ever tells you that...
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Because that would be too easy.
Fuck off.
Yeah, look at that thing.
I'll miss you.
Do you like massage?
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Tomorrow.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Good...I'm tired.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
It's amazing  there!
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
What happened?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I found them in your file box.
I found the pentacle.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
What did you hear?
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
He spoke to you?
You raised me, like a son.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I had to.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
I'm going to look around.
We're going to do this.
What are these?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Terrific.
Whish the circumstances were different.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
I can manage.
Yeah, you met her?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
The blue.
You sure?
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
This time get your feet set.
You want the job or not?
You could make a career by telling me where.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
I know...
I told him you looked like me.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
They ever love you back?
Thanks.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
Okay.
Good.
You having fun?
Yeah.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
You do see me standing here, right?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Fine, Quincy.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
It happens, right...
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Few days ago.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Figured it was something like that.
Wow.
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
What?
For what?
Well, can you give him this for me?
I have.
He tore his ACL.
What are you doing in my room?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
What mess?
We need to talk.
I ain't a damn liar.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
No.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
You want me to fuck off?
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Oh, she's fine.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Yeah.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not -- what's a 422?
Thank you.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
No, no.
Let's make a deal.
You really use strong language.
Yeah, of course.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
That was so great what you just said.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
You mind if I come in, check things?
I want a shot of tequila too.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
I was listening --
What?  What does that mean?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yeah.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Get a girlfriend.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
I've seen it before.
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
Is that still lingering?
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
It's all important --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
She's retired.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
And your father?
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
Right.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Ok.
Uh. huh.
You can't just come in here.
What does it look like?
No one else in here?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
And what about screaming?
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Bye.
Do you love me, Rose?
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
...No....
But you can't say....
I'm her father.
I'II go....is it...back here?
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
....it's alright....
...I don't....
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
yeah.
I need this one.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Stand up.
And you were not hurt?
Nothing... Nothing.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
Replace the king.
Tomorrow.
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
What is that?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Your mother's.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Your Majesty has had many women --
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
No, Keeper.
Eh?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
... Nothing.
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
Seattle.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
1490...Breckinridge...
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I'm not going anywhere!
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
How are Molly and the boy?
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
When do they go to press?
Book code?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
As long as they're dead...
These are all dead, Will.
Get him to Atlanta.
What do you want to do?
I know...
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
I'll pick you up in...
That's narrow?
'Changes?'
Something Lecktor said.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Have him peel the top label back.
Three minutes.
He went to the men's room.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
The Tooth...
Was I in an accident?
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Yes...
Yes.
Are you a man?
No.
No.
Where did you get it?!
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Thank you very much.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
We have it good, don't we?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Come home with me.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Thanks.
Yes.
I figured I'd ask you...
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
She got all right?
...yes.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
George, I hate sitcoms.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
But wasn't it funny?
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Tony Clifton.
Deal.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
It's me.
You're a wimp.
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
Where?
He said he's coming back!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Know what?
And you are?
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
No, it's all right.
How many were there?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
We have no choice.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
What do you know?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
I think I do.
Of the Resistance.
That's why we're here.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
He is the One.  He is the One!
How did you know...?
Not too bright though.
What?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
Who is?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
But an Oracle can.
Should I be?
What?
Do what?
It wasn't fast enough.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
He's alive.
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
I can't!
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No you're not...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Well...
Maybe, who knows.
Don't ask.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Sure...He lives there?
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Yeah, it's your father's.
You could say that.
Can you spare it?
You ate?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
A name?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
And that?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Am I not obligated to?
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
In my sleep.
Did you just hear something?
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
You have a way with words.
Please, Drew.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I know.  Gum up the works.
Thanks, Quince.
Yeah.  Neat.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
No, no.  I on holiday.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Nuthin'.
She knows you real self?
No.  Nothing.
It's so very nice to see you again.
I didn't know that.
Oh yes, I do.
I'm sorry.
I've got plenty of friends.
I came to see you.
I don't know.
Girlfriend?
'To bed'?
Why don't you get off his case?
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
No.
What do you mean?
No.
Are you sad, Bill?
Well...I don't know.
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
Those were my words, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
Thank you.
Death!
I do?  How long will you be staying?
I'm sorry, I --
It's enough now.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
How did you know?
You like him, don't you?
I know it's none of my business --
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Uh oh --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
You're not listening --
Don't get dirty, Dad --
You're terrible.
What?!
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
I could be her.
'Her'.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
No, it was so right it scares me.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Amnesia?
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
What?
Then why is this my handwriting?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
You did.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Don't remember.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
There are things you know for sure.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
I'll go see him.
About your whore of a wife?
Dying.
What?
What are you here for?
I don't know.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
You've read it a hundred times.
Teddy!
Mr Gammell?
John Gammell?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
You like it? Let's trade.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
What sort of questions?
Are you sure?
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
When?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
She's dead...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
I know.  And now?
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Alonzo...
Something's wrong.
Nothing.
Five minutes...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Verdado.
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Switek?
Then you should.
If you're down, we're down for the play.
Okay.  What's up?
That's right.
What are you talking about?
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Not French registry?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
"Future" of...?
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
I had to lay eyes on you.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! -- and there you are, you handsome devil.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Don't need a comb.
Twenty bucks...
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Get outta my way.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
Get down -- where?
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Get lost.
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
Two kilos.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty months?
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
You want to split your hernia again?
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Everything.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Sixty Lira?
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Stupid.
Just what?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
That doesn't seem so bad.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
He wasn't even in the car?
Seven years...
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
Billy!  Please!
Where is it?
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
It's already been cut.
You know where it is?
Max - where?
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Work, work, work, that's all do
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Yeah...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Nino, please...
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Susan, we're not b-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
It didn't bite me.
What-
She used a baster.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
What do you want to know?
Anything you can tell me might help.
It's right this way.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
You got a point there...
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
It has no nobility.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Misery?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
Then who did?
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
Oh...
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Well, it certainly says you.
You really think so?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
No, I haven't.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm glad you like it.
Four or five days ago. Why?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
What? What is it?
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
Oh, I like that tone.
You think he might be missing?
So do I...
I'm sure you're right.
Answer me a couple things?
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Magic...
And my room?
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
What else?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Lovely.
More like two-two point two million.
I hope there's a place to land.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Who wants to be decent?..
They've got a book for this?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
I don't.
And that's the only reason?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Yes?
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
You gotta be kidding.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
And then what?
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Yes.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
That simple, huh?
Left jacket pocket?
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
S.O.P..
Good idea.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Oh yeah?
There was nobody on the bridge.
You're sure about this?
Bastard!
Okay...
Go secure.
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Like Job?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
He won't be back in a hurry?
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Yeah.
How did Kittridge do it?..
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Good luck.
Of course I can hear you.
Loud and clear.
Jack you're so wicked.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Thank you, Rose.
And go to confession.
The guy died.
What killed him?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
Let's go tell your Mother.
Instantaneous.
I don't know.
Stupid.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Stop it!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It makes you look like an angel.
I'm marrying your brother!
I can't!
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
Kinda gaudy.
Come on.
It's the best thing there is.
Awful?
I wanna go home.
I'm really afraid.
No.
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
You? No.
Will you marry me?
Yes?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Seven-thirty.
Sure.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
What! How do you know?
No. Are you drunk?
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
Yes.
Okay, I'll tell her.
Good.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
What do you do?
Why do men chase women?
No.
Yes.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Cosmo.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Oh. Right.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Does wood sink in water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Please!
Am I right?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
Then you shall die.
I move for no man.
Had enough ... ?
You're a looney.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
My liege ... forgive me ...
Just keep me covered.
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Greetings King Arthur.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Charge!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
I don't know that!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
Not you.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
I don't think I was.
You've come to rescue me?
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Not down south you don't.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
You know what I mean.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Get out.  Out!
I can't move to tidy.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Quite.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
My own.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
I beg your pardon?
I am a blank sheet.
Quite.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
In time, she will.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
He thought so, yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
I was told you were in a fight.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Is that not enough?
To know when he'll be king.
Not too protracted, I hope.
I have no idea.
Your Majesty --
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
He is sick, ma'am.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
How'd you know it was us?
What's her problem?
Yeah...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
We can't...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Then where do we go?!
No I'm not...
I can't believe you made it!
Dante's Inferno.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Yes I am...
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
What?
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
That's impossible.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
What did you say?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
I'll speak to someone.
No problem. What's on your mind?
How's that?
Okay, I'm thinking.
One.
Okay.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
... What??
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Yes, there was.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Not that I can see.
"But you won't..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Do you know them?!
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No...
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Not listening !
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
He hired you to build this place ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
Not quite....
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
That's cute asshole.
Thanks...
What ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Fire the whole division.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Sir ?
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
Then what do you want ?
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I'll see that bet.
You're paying the bills.
The power went out in half the park.
Do you want to go out with me ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I would do it again in a minute.
What about living in the real world pal?
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Of course.
I will. How's Shelly?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
I told you it was a long story.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Come on in!
ehh...I don't know I mean....
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
What can I do for you?
O.K. Thank you very much.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
He is one of the great poets.
Does it work?
Just give it to me!!
Uh oh...
Leave me alone!!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Yeah?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
No?
But...are you engaged or something?
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Excuse me?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Sort of?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
It would be fantastic.
You leave your father to me.
I know, look at his little hands.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Good for you baby.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Okay.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Good.
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Hand me the canula.
Can I go too?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
No, no no....
Hi, is Vada home?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Will you tell her I came by?
This is one big house for one single person.
Thirty five dollars.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Oh yes, yes.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
He likes her.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
My Dad was funny?
That's really cool.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Oh great!!
Goodnight.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Sorry.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
Just, hurry.
Okay.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
I have a suggestion...
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
What do you suggest?
Manicure...
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
And what will he do?
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
You need a few dollars.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
... that this is all my fault?
... unless he has a hump.
... look good on Kimberly.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
What's next?
Endearingly absent-minded.
Quite the little eccentric.
What, leaving school...
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
... maybe it's congratulations.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
A bad combination.
Well, it happens.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
What is that sup...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
I won first prize.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
What did you say your name was?
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
They can come to the concert in the park.
I said 'no!'
Who the hell is he?
What!
You know better than that.
To the bathroom.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
He's a member of our congregation.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I've got a gig tonight.
Car pool?
That's what you said before.
I know. Goodbye.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Money's no object.
Glad to meet you.
Yes.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Where's Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
How long have you been together?
I'm Opal.
What?
You do?
You always live there?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Who?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Is that good?
May I see your costume?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I see.
How's it goin'?
What?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
What?
Anything.
It's video.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Then was it worth it?
Was what worth it?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Says who?
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Capt'n!
Rockin'!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
When do you want the assembly?
They're mesmerising.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Yeah.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
See Duff. He's the money man.
All right, you get out of here, man!
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
People seen him 'round.
I don't know.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Oh yeah?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Okay, I will.
No. I'm new in town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
I like a place with lots of life.
How about another beer?
Don't Duff--
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Scared, huh?
No, on the porch.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
I didn't know you had one.
Are you married?
No. But a small one.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Yeah, that's so.
My kids want me to teach them.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
You will.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
What 'you signifyin'?
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
'Don't sound so sure.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
No thanks, Lee.
Sure.
Who is?!
Thank you.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
What are you talking about?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
What?
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
What are you talkin' about?
How's the ice break?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
I thought you already left.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Maybe something's onto him.
What the fuck... are you serious?
So you're a wire junkie.
Too late?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
It sounds like you.
Shhh...
Yeah.
I know you have. C'mere.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
What?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Oh I know.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Nope.
Roger in Op/Ed.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
You need my help?
Five-- Six--
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
OUT!
What if I say no?
Hey. There.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You were attracted to me?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
Barrel.
For this.
Yes.
Just what?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
It's getting there.
It's not the gas, Dad!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
Get outa here.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
No shit.
Only the wet ones.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I'm sorry...
Are you nuts or something?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
I don't know.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
Why won't you talk to me?
I killed him!  I killed him!
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Huh?
Okay, I guess.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Did she always have nightmares?
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Can't it wait till morning?
Watching TV.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
He's real.
How do we find him, Kristen?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Sounds like a rough time.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
The truth.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
I can do that.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
What about Kristen?
Neil, please --
How do we get in?
No.  We're alone.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Where...here?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Really?
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Thanks.  Well...
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Absolutely fine about it.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
I don't know either.
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Right.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Stay forever.
Don't ask.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
Can I have your autograph?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Well, fire away.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I believe I have.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
And she's in your house.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Oh.  Right.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
I-I-I...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
I wanna report a robbery!
What for?
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Thank you, ma'am...
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
O-o-o-oh...
Go ahead! Go back!
Yeah, kid?
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Yeah!
What?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Did to me?
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
Okay, sucker.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
No!
Let me see your hand!
Bye-bye.
He is!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Time out!
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah!
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Are you a doctor?
Big man!
On what?
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
How 'bout twenty?
Why, sure, ma'am...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
At this hour?
Yes, ma'am...
What?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
What is it?
Your great aunt.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
What?...
Hi there...
My picture's up?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
That was before I found out what it was.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes.
What?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Yeah.
You too.
We were hungry.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Very funny.
Yes.
Any night.
Yes?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
I think he's having an affair.
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
What's that supposed to mean?...
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
Larry bought himself cologne?
What's she saying?
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
A little bad luck?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Kate.
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
That's exactly what you are.
Good strategy.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Thanks.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
It's a living.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
Man, you were a mess!
I don't know.
How do you like it?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
You?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Get away from me.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
But you still hold out for silence?
Are you on the level, Father?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
What?
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
My favorite little cousin.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
Thanks, Johnny... .
Aw, Johnny... .
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
How'd you get that.
Listen, Johnny
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Keep Charley out of this.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
I am--It's our only chance.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
...And I thought you loved me.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
You love me then?
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Yes, Master.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He called the day he escaped.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
She's coming with us.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Sure looks that way.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
Shit.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
I could walk out of here.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Wait, I know him --okay?
I bet.  How much?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Buddy.  That's his given name?
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
You don't act like it.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Sure.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Is that right?
You'd probably tell me.
That's my dad.
How do we do that?
You won't do that.
Because you're having too much fun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Those guys bother you?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
I called your room from downstairs.
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
So she did help you?
You know what I mean.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
In the trunk?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Hejira.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
And is Foley a part of this?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
What-- when?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
I'm looking for Maurice.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
No.
Your dog was killed?
It's a --
No thanks.
Dad...
I really gotta go.
No, he looks a lot...
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
I imagine you would've though.
I told you, he isn't here.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Still...
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Are they dead?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
You mean hiding them?
Yes Sir.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You guys are new?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Yeah.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Little less.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Home of the Brave.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Well...sure.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Sorry to trouble you.
What do you get for winning?
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
You too, 'Mam.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Brilliant, Admiral.
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Go on. You can do it.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I'm not going.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Pretty strange.
Would you?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Thanks.
Good.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Just take a look at it. 
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I thought you were...for a while.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Coffee and a donut.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
I'm excused.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
For what?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
Give me some credit, will you?
When do we start?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Pretty much so.
How'd you know that?
Yes... why?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
You sure did...
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
Sure.
I still can't believe she's dead...
Zowie.
You never get over it.
Yeah...
He was dead. You know he was.
Go later...
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
One hour!
Drew!
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I'm not going to close the--
Maybe you should think about it.
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
Congratulations.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Nine.
Continue.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Rayisha. Very nice.
Thank you.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Beckett?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've considered that.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Yes.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Right.
Were you pleased with his work?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
You're in trouble.
In a word, yes.
Aren't you?
Lots.
Night, honey.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Look deeper.
You sure you can keep --
We can't make it.
I can't....I can't....
It's starting....
Possibly.
Probably right.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
25 kilos each, huh?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
79 kilos.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
We're all on the same hajj now.
For now.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
About the girl.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Shut up.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Neither do I.
Remembers what?
You didn't think so then.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Let's take a look.
Come on. Get me out of here.
Zira doesn't want your female.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
To scare off humans?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
Where are they now?
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
I got one...
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
What's the matter?
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
Just drunk enough.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Sure... but somebody always does..
How did you meet him?
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Why not?
I didn't notice him.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
No use waiting, then.
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
They're going to arrest me.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
This must have cost a fortune.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
That, and the fun of it.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
Do you think I was faking?
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
For two hundred?
A thousand.
That comedian?
We do, when we get the chance.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Passkey?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Floater?
Send that?
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Are you always this witty?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
He checks too.
The card says so, doesn't it?
But you still think she's innocent.
Why should I mind?
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I have a rough idea.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Yes.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Well, we were just...
Yes.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
In radio we're different.
I think she liked me.
He's all right, the professor.
What did he want?
Why not.
I know.  I'm sorry.
To the Fleet.
It's shit.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
I'm not sure.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Yes.
They won't let you in without one.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
I'll take that as a yes.
Okay!
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
But you're not alone.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
I say when it's over!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Sir?
Fine.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
The fucking punks are surfers.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Who cares!
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
You never did know when to quit.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
You know you can't win this one.
Right behind you.
It's been a long time, General.
What's that, General?
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
You what?
Sit... and spin.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Stolen?
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Fine.
You know how to drive a stick?
Do you plan everything?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Don't drown.
I'm in town until Saturday.
I got a dress, yeah.
You're forgiven.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Please.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
The opera.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Business.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
The young lady staying in your room?
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
We just did.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
I'm up.
All this because of that whore!
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I pray for that.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I'm just looking, thanks.
It's very expensive.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Well ... you were dead.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Yes, some of the time. 
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Over the Albino, I think.
Right, right, sorry.
What is it?
Open it up.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Yeah. It's really good.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
Sire.
No.  To the pain.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Not yet.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Then why are you smiling?
And what is that?
Okay.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Scared.  Can't talk.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Yes, it's quite possible.
One night.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
You're going to jump on me.
What???
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Oh.
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Double.  Double.  Double.
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
What is it?
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
Always.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Very nice girl.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Send for Goebbels.
No.
I'm not the police.
Oh.
What?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
What?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Now, look...!
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
All right.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
I want to know if my sister is here.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What's the matter?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
No.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Contemplate your... panic button.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Without calling me?
Does that mean we can't...
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Sam! No!
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Uncommon, too.
Only my share.
Good night.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Leave me alone!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
A voice ...
There's no child here.
No?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
So that's the way it is?
I'd love to, at any time.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Get out of here.
Now don't that call for an extra!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
What does that prove?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Is that a fact?
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
But who were they?
You were pretty bad, huh?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Actually, I am, though.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
'Course it does.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I don't want to know...
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
What are they doing?
Is that all?
That's what she would say herself.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
All right, darlin'.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I am not being brutal to her!
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Is anything wrong?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Yes, sir.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
She looks terrible, just awful.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Abe Lincoln...
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Again.
No you can't.
Get ready.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
You don't smoke.
Birth control's important.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
No, we're stealing.
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Maybe.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
Shit.  You're right.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Billy!  Billy!
Yeah.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Where am I?
Who are you?
As you wish.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Wouldn't miss it.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
We got separated.
Ahhh...
Here's the terminal.
Lower it!
All right, hang on.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yes.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Disintegrated?
Oh well.  How about you.  
Yes.
Oh...
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Yes.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Weiss.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
You're OK by me.
Oh no no no no.
...Fine.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
Do you have a phone?
It's fine.
It's not that --
Ya puttin' me on, right?
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Apollo?
Christ.
You didn't!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
That's it, I'm broke.
A few bucks.
No action.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
Freak luck for sure.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I never had good footwork.
Fine... That guy's great.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Maybe another job is the best thing.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
You ballin' her?
You serve martinis, doncha?
So where is it then?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Sounds like singin'.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Surprised?
Toon cops worked me over.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
That's what you woke me up for?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Safe?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Good idea.
Leave Me!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
By my heel, I care not.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
She'll not come down tonight.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
By the hour of nine.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
A most courteous exposition.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Not yet...
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Ready when you are...
What's that?
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
But you hate each other!
I swear...
It's done.
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
You seem one to me.
I don't think so.
I can do that.
Something like that...
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Jujitsu.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So is the woman.
Who am I?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
You were smoking?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
I know of him.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I'm sure.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What's that?
I...I can't do that.
I don't know...
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
No.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
That's right.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
I'm all ears.
What are you proposing?
I want my share. All of it.
What are you doing, Earl?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
Has he?
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you Sally.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Lingerie...
Shopping here?
No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
Sure.
A lot of men come in here?
Why?
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Right behind you.
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
So I want the money and I want it now.
We're gonna talk.
Yeah.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Give me the bad news.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I'd like to see you try.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
El Capitan?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
No.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
How you doin'?
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
This is a very dangerous man.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Who?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Who?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
She saved our lives.
Why did you help me?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Who's Benjamin?
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Just GO!
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I need your help.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
You must come with me for questioning.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Yes, Master.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
OK. Say what it is.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
That silly-ass look on your face.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
You don't know what a shortcut is?
The license!  You get it?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
It happens.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Going into the restaurant.
What?
I could get promoted right out of here.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Do it!
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Good one!  Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Never say die."
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Poor Ike.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
And you defending her?
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
We'll see.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Cindy the manicurist.
Still sweet.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
No.
Agreed.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
I already explained about that.
Brian told you that?
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I kissed him back.
Really?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Not eight...
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
It's just like my grandmother's china.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Yes.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, I know that part --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
What?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
How did it happen?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
It's been about a year and a half.
No.
Fair enough.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Right, right.
Eighty dollars.
Window.
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
It's a sign.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
There she is.
What do you mean?
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
Absolutely.  Right.
He's good at it.
There's nothing stopping you.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What's more important than sanitation?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Aaah, what's the use?
I'm a fool.
No, no ...
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He'll have it good. Some day.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Backward.
Sure.
Yes.
I've had them since the day they were born.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
A meeting?
Ramn -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are you saying?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
You know I don't think that.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
What attitude?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Are you Australian?
That bad, huh?
Ouch.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
I just can't. Okay?
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Lead the way.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I don't trust anybody.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Why do you say that?
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
I'll keep that in mind.
Just some buddies.
It's not my place.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
When?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Yeah.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Again, I thank you.
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
What do you mean?
Better than drugs.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
I guess.
It was nothing.
You know classical music?
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
That only leaves three.
Plenty.
Sure, you got one?
I changed my mind.
What about the company?
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
That's not what we're here for.
You never know.
How about I go right, sir?
Vecchio.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
You want me to take over?
Yes, sir.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Ours is not to reason why.
You have orders, too.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Captain, he's fast!
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Who knows?  It worked.
Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
This evening is over.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
But you never had a first date.
C'mon, just do it.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I can accept that.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
You like it?
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Tell me, is it bad news?
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Crash paranoia.
Okay, I give up.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Just finishing up in here.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah.
No, I read it on the message.
Well, not monumentally.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Eight.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
Won't you see me later?
Come on.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Yeah.
Oh.  I was putting the...
No.
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
Is this because of your dad?
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
Good to know.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Uh... okay... um...
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Are you?
She's very successful.
I know
Very talented.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Hey.
Yeah.
How you doin', brother?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
We're full on bonded.
Yeah, alright.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Now you're back.
He is.
Sir, the list is correct.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Yeah, what's that?
True.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
Look it up.
You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
That's great, thanks.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
The war could end.
What other point is -
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
On national television.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
I did that.
And much richer as a result.
Why don't you ask them?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
No way.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
I got it..
He hates Oliver Stone.
Until now.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I know that.
Yeah?
And Joel's pre-med.
Humor me, Sid.
Whatever.
What if your life depended on it?
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
You're getting obvious.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
What?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The young girl is slashed again.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
He's after me.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
Good bye Ben.
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Please, call me Gale.
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Did you request this case?
What does this have to do with Sid?
What?  When?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Follow me.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
I'm on duty.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Bitch.
Just because you knew her?
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Who's this.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
But you know my favorite name?
Roman that's not the line.
My movie.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Who is this?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Oh Sidney...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
What?
You don't still think it was me?
What number is this?
To apologize.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Really? What?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
They'd never make it in time.
So you better leave.
Afraid not.
Your call.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Hold up a sec...
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Call the police.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
That's the original part.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
You got it.
You coming tonight?
So what's his reason?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Which is you...
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
It's all part of the game.
The official term is "psychotic".
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Bye.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
What am I? The beer wench?
Give it to me.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
What are you talking about?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Hello.
Why?
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
What the fuck is going on?
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
I realize that.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
Guessing at this point is useless.
No.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
What about sports?
Forced what?
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
The fingerprints.
And?
Yes we do.  Here...
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
You got to be kidding.
We're focusing.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
What happened?
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Are you absolutely certain?
What?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
Really?
I hate this city.
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
Why don't you finish the job?
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
In that case, give the boys room...
Dunno...Seems so.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
How many, would you say?
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Sir?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
You've done a lot of growin'...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
What?
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
It isn't fair...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
But couldn't you...?
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Oh God, Tommi...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I mean the armchair!
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
We should leave the past alone.
Very funny.
The title won't do.
Thank you, Ned.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
No Juliet?!
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Nothing comes.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Who is that?
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
How will it?
What do we do now?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
And yours?
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Ethel.
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Be still.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Verona again.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
It is strange to me, too.
And that was only my first try.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Then I will go with you.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Will you shut up and play.
Why, thank you, David.
No.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I won't be able to.
Is that going to be deep enough?
I want to talk now.
Security.
Your friends.
Except the money.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Well, then?
I don't know them.
Parked outside?
Sorry to waste your time.
Yes.
What?
Yes.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yes.
Really?
Well, she had problems --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is --
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
What?
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
Where he can't get it?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
We were just sorting things out.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Someone lost the key.
Yes.
Here?.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Did he sound upset?
I suppose so.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
No.
Why?
What?
That you were just indulging me.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
What are you talking about?
You mean that girl, don't you?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
Gee, that's very serious...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
What about?
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
That headboard.
Are you?
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Making it with my mother?
No shit.
Great.
Wonderful woman.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Yes, Buffums.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
I don't know. Probably not.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'm sure.
Probably the bathroom.
Great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
What's wrong?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Did you?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
I just have to do one little thing.
Did I what?
You're a genius.
I don't want to... I swear...
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
Fuckin' A --
No you didn't.
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- Otis?
-- you know better...
I just... who what?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay.
Yeah, baby.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Commercials.
-- go ahead.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
What do you wanna know for?
How?
Jesus.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Thank you.
I know what you mean.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
What about, tonight?
See she doesn't drink too much.
All night.
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
Well, I don't know.
Oh yeah...
What do you mean?
Sid.
I am?
Really? How about starting with tonight?
What's that?
Fine.
Does she know about us?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
But you have problems?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
Well, there was this one time --
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- He reached up and tore them.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Johnny!
-- never mind.
He's a hairdresser.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Of course not.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Do you have something against traveling?
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
They had to, in order to survive.
Yes, Dad.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Do you feel bad?
Do you like this hotel?
What do you mean?
No.
Who's Tony?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Try to think what it was.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay.
No.
Yes?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Do I have to?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Grady... oh.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
Your money's no good here.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
I know it.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Good.
Yes.
Jack...
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Oh, it sure would be
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Royalty?
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
Fine.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
Yeah! What is it?
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Will you do it?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
I think I hear it!
SING!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
What?
You bastard!
This prom is a real drag.
HE'S SO FINE.
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Enough jabber.
You know that song?
Wet behind the ears.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Hopeless I
Babies
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
What?  What time is it?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Keep moving!
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
I am?
What?
No.  No.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
A vote?
I must go where I can be of use.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
He didn't do you a favor.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Where is she?
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
We're losing it.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
It's better than springtime.
She said they were from her old convent.
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
Bring him.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
A fine idea.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
How could he?
Look again.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
What happened?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Are you so superstitious?
They have done nothing of the sort.
Must I hear this?
And this gives worth to butchery?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
The skull is gone.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
No.  She has gone out.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Yes.  Here...
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
You got any money?
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, what did you want?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
They was a boy. We made friends.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
What are all them books?
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Who did you kill?
Two people.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Where'd you get them flowers?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Oh, jackin' off?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
No sir.
It was fun, anyhow.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
He ain't ever okay to me.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Did Karl go to bed?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I love you, too, Mama.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
You better go get your things.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
My history.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Do you have family here?
Naw, I ain't.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Oh. How about before that?
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Can I help you, sir?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Will he be supervised?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
An invitation?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
That's the subject of my last chapter.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
No, he's not. You are.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Hi, Auggie.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
It means "happiness."
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
No you're not.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
For keeps.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
And these?
What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
And his parents?
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
It'll cost you five bucks.
Not a one.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Say hi to Paul.
Thomas.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
So what's the time?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
The what?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
He's dead?
Drawing's a good thing.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
You don't really want to know.
And?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Come on, just a little hint.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
That money is my whole future.
Fries?
Oh, yeh?
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Pretty darn clear.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Have a look.  At nothing.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The knife.  What knife?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
It's entirely mutual.
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
- Type O.
We're not too late, are we?
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Done what?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
What message?  What motorboat?
That's right.
WHAT?
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Sugar?
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm fine.
When?
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Yeah - Josephine.
Well, I'll come back later.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Yes.  For a whole year.
We could dye our hair.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
I'm not surprised.
This is where I get off.
I'll throw up!
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
Thank you.
It's three weeks in Florida -
And you'll be in all evening?
My car?  Why, you -
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Bingo?
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I want mine to wear glasses.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Want to switch berths with me?
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
My fault.
I don't think so.
I beg your pardon?
You don't say!
Shells?  Whatever for?
It's the thought that counts.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Three?
What is it?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
You mean - like frigid?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Oh, no!
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
From a rich millionaire.
Me?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Big joke!
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Spats Colombo.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
Actually, I do.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
She did?
No, thats not it.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Crikey.
What?
You Yanks and your therapy. Its great.  Its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Shampoo, got it!
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Oh, cut the crap!
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
Hi.
Will do.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
That's where we come from first?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
What do that mean?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Hi to you, son...
He'll show up one day.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
What's that, son?
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Yes, David...
Where did it come from, Mama?
Children, come here...
David, come back here!
Good night...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
I'm used to it.
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Tired.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Is there something I can do to help you?
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Eric!
About what?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
How the fuck should I know!!
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
A hunger strike? For what?
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Uhh...
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
What about air strikes?
Yes?
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Oh yeah!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Stan.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Look answer my question!
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Uh...
You better start making sense!
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
Taylor, you surprise me.
That's clear.
Over and out!
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Just considering our options... sir.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Yeah?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
We have room!  Let's go!
And so far.
Except write our wills.
That's right.  Will you marry me?
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
I know but we're in a bind.
One moment please...  one moment please...
You're not from around here, are you?
A bowler.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Wish me luck.
It's mine.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
You wish!
I couldn't care less.
I am underground.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Who's there?
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
After we eat, Dad.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Line up where you want it.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Like this?
Whips...orange whips.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
The mental hospital.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Why were you suspended?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You got any broken bones?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
He's my father.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
He's dead Sheila.
You should.
I am a professional man.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Fletcher, I want you back here.
Get out of there!
Wait a minute --
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Norman, don't do it!
Captain.
What team?
Anything else?
It's impossible.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Wait -- down where?
What -- are you threatening me?
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
You, me and Harry?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You think?
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
What's that?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
You want to kill him?
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
You tell me.
Are you manifesting them?
But --
You manifested that, Beth.
You're insane.
I never went in that sphere.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
You hear that?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
It doesn't make any sense.
For who?  The fish?
You'd have to ask them.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
You holding up alright?
Time travel.  A black hole.
Am I?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
You don't remember that?
How do we decode it?
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
That's right.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
This way, sir.
What report?
Know what?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Try this one.
Why's that?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Not bad.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
What do you mean?
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I think I did.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Not enough, I guess.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Funny...
Excuse me...!
It's all I think about anymore.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Who cares ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Should I be ?
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
What happened to your eye ?
I like it. It's kinda...you.
See you on the bounce !
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Uh, look, Diz...
You got it.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Oh, is that how it is ?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Hi, mom.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Yeah, that's right.
Been better, buddy.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
Who's that with you ?
What's going on, Diz ?
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
You asked my opinion, sir.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
This served the purpose.
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Viewer, standard ahead.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Sure plan to.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
It's about life.
It's...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
I...
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Oh.
Because I'd met someone else.
Go you Huskies!
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Gosh, you look nice.
It does?
You know what else a man can do?
Well ain't you amazing.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I'll knit you a sweater.
Water or mineral deposits.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Go you Huskies...
That's so beautiful...
Where have you been...
I'm sorry.
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Courthouse back in town.
Now: I'm looking at the...
Fifteen hands.
Nothing happened.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I'm having dinner with W...
I...
She's a...
What I...
Joe, the writer?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
The Mayor's outside.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
But not that <u>way</u>...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yes, yes, but...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
Who are these from?
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Bob are you alright...?
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Why not?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Yes.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
Not now.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Um, no.
Where have you been...?
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I can write it.  I can't type it.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
What's in all the bags?
I don't got the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Sherry, this...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
And we're glad to have you here...
...the city council...
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...
Yes, I hear it.
Mmm...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I killed her!
I hate when you say that.
Mass hysteria.
It happens.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Or blush.  You look pale.
I'll be there for you.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
See, I...
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
Ice cold water.
Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
I knew where I was all the time.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
If you want me to hate her I will.
Is that like Luigi's?
Thursday's fine...
You have the WORST flu since...
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You say that like I don't know that.
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Every day.  More and more.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Have you still never told him?
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Good...Well...Take care.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
What did you do?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Jackie?
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
I lost him.  I was panicked.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Rache, it may take time.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
I needed some time away.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Does Jackie know this?
Maybe he's gay.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Really? How many?
No, Mikey.
This is work.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
Yes, Mikey?
What?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
OK!
Hi, Dad!
Maybe. She's OK.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Thank you for being honest.
Take off your top.
Ni...
Say, 'Nigger.'
Again!!
I hate reading.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello, is this Pam?
Great!
Yeah.
Great. How old are they?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Yeah?
I mean...
He did?
Oh.
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah?...
You're talking about committing suicide!
Even better.
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
I'll let the senator tell you.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Richter-we got a problem!
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
That's right, fella.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
A shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
That's right, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
To peace on earth.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
I presume the planes are armed?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Then there's no chance for recall?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
How long will it take to receive them all?
How many planes did we lose?
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary arming switch.
What's your point, Lothar?
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
But who would be chosen?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Knock yourself out.
How long were you in there?
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Mm-hm.
Slides go with it.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Okay, whatever you want.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Shut up! Aw...
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Okay.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No. Life is too short.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Hey, man.
No, no, no.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Really?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
No, but I heard it was great.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Hey, thanks, man.
You could do it.
Yeah!
Yeah.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
Mm.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
No.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Just go home, alright?
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Just put it down.
Look, your trespassing.
That's right.
You could've come over.
Yes.
So you can give me more shit?
About what?
I'm talking about idealism.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Mm.
For a ride.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, fuck it, man!
What?
What?
What do you mean?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Get off my property!
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
So? What's L.A. like?
Would I get paid?
Alright!
I'm moving.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Nobody's fucking anybody!
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Yeah.
Yeah.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Fuck.
Don't swear it's impolite.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Well...
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Yeah.
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
Where's the bar?
I'll take it.
Nothing for Ladd?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
I tell you this is half sold.
Well, for heaven's sake!
Why should you do that?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
Come on in, Betty,
Why did she call me?
What assistant?
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
This is fascinating.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
What month?
Where do you live?
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I've lost my car.
Come on!
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Cut out that us business.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
This is the right day.
Where are your...?
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Yes, Norma.
Good.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
Sorry, mistress.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Have fun.
Eliminate her.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Who didn't?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I'm not mad at you.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
Yes.
How do I fight it?
I'll mention it upstairs.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
How do you know?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I allowed it to escape the City.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
I don't understand.
She's a beast.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
You sure?
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I have to talk to you.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
Are you happy, Zaltar?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Why?
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Oh?
What are you doing?
First paycheck?
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Who gets it, the company?
Uh...
Which country?
What?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Turn on the T.V.
Huh?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Everything.
Stone mutha.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Anytime.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
He can have mine. Anytime.
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Hello.
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Be my guest.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
What??
Maybe you wanted to.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
I'll be alright.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
I asked the right question.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
North. Keep going North!
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Yes, but will you honor it?
Sentimental idiot.
I really don't think . . .
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Yes, darling?
. . . And  very nave!
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
I made you, and I can destroy you.
He's thirty-five years old.
You're a great architect, Albert.
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Well!
No.
Not really, no.
What the  --  !
Oh, for God's sake!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
It wasn't a trick!
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Of this...Superman.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
First the pets, Otis.
He's from another world.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
No, you're going to get kissed,
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
I didn't bring any  --
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
He'll be weightless.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Twenty-four.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
He is. Usually.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
It is for me.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Maybe I should get help.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
We're...not together.
That's okay.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Say hi to Zoe.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Okay.
Say hello for me.
It does concern me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
C'mon, you know that won't...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Billy, that's too early.
That's because he misses you.
Your kids never cry.
Sure.
Just like we look forward to this.
Good night.
About the Ottos?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
That would complicate things.
He knows that?  Billy?
Why would he be frightened?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
From you?
It's the truth.
It's like a song.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Should I keep reading?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
She...she was a friend of mine.
That's the local bar?
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Almost three.
Is this it?
Yes.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
In what way?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Will the police do anything to her?
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
But of course...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
I doubt that it matters any more.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Give me a chance --
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
I have a message from your sister.
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
I don't?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
You're sure.  Find out for me.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
But what?
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
I made you write a beautiful song...
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
What chip?
Those lying motherfuckers!
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
What does that mean?
Can I stop by my house?
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Why?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Smile?
Pain causes it?
Drive faster.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Go!  I'll finish here.
So do you.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
Eating is eating... and...
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
So, what does the Russki want?
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Yes.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
You bet.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What's in those files?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I would like to go now, please.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Sure.
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
I wish to say something.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
That's what I asked.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Yes, you remember.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Sure.
They said I was dogged?
First oboe.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
I don't understand...
The what?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
What?
Okay.  Talk some more.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Someone?
And so you feel nothing.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What... is... happening... ?
What are you talking about?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Please...
My hero.  Let's go.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Why... ?
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Come here...
Well... the red bra.
What's wrong?
Get out.
That's a lie...
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Get us out!
Stop talking to them!
No...
Stop it!
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Boyfriend?
Never better.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
You need anything?
Trust me.  Call that number.
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
You're part of it...
What?  Connie...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
I'll call.  I really will.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
It's all down to this...
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Look, where is he?!
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Just stay there, Nell!
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I don't know.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Sure.
That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Mary came with me.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
I don't know what you mean.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
We all did.
I'm a gracious host.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why not?
I wouldn't talk.
Been to the Boat Show.
Huh?
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
This ain't your lot?
Where abouts?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
One thing I need.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
You just cooking then?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
No, why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
That's not what I heard.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
I'll bloody well ask him.
What about your grandmother?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Bloke told me.
Of the deal, man.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Five thousand.
I got half.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Something's on.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Is he here?
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
He didn't say that.
Huh.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well? How'd she do?
Uh--
You're out of line, mister.
Cash.
All right.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Told what?
Oh, don't be a grump.
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
...OK.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
I don't know. I don't think so.
Yeah.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Oh, hell. Drink?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
...You ever wonder about it?
What the--
No thanks, I--
He said OK. Is that what he said?
I don't want to scare people.
Where's the walk-in safe?
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
What doors?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
You said the system couldn't fail!
Like hell!
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Yes.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Keep the animal quiet.
So what?
And John?
I don't understand.
Behind me.  Over there.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
It's scared of me.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
That's right.
What's to see?
He gave it back to his father.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
That and a fat, new contract.
That's correct.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
You're the star.
--You never had a camera in my head.
You think she'd go through with it?
Saturday?
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Really?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
I made macaroni.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
I bet you did.
Truman, stop it!
Well, thank you for your help.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
I'd ask for identification.
You can count on it.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Yes.
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
There are complications.
What's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
How?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
-- You saw this experiment?
No you didn't.
I'm in the vending room.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
No.
Get dressed, Scully.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
All the equipment is brand new.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Yeah...?
Well, call General McAddie.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Is she alive?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
What alien environment?
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
I'd be there for him.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I realize that...
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
No problem.
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Now.
What else do we do?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Ja, ja, ja.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
I was told there were only two men there.
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
Where is she?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
I'll put these flowers in water.
How did you know I would be here?
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
They'll be returned, miss.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't...
How will I know you?
No, not yet.
Yes.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Schmolka!
Holly Martins.
No.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
You're not locking her up?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Well, there's not much time.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Never heard of him.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
But you will.
Must be some mistake.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Yes.
Well make it your business.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Where are you staying?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
That's the wrong one.
I'm sorry.
Incredible.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
No one follows that midrash.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You will.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Is he a Nazi?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
No.
I'm good at languages.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
You can't curse in front of it either.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
What's it about?
Fuck that.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
No. What are you looking for?
You don't own this place.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
How would you kill him?
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Of course they're Jews.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
Think about your father. Your sister.
Balint?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Steve's going to explain it.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
Number ten.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
So what do we do with the device?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Four. But no one this important.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
What's that?
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Fund-raising??
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
What d'you mean?
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
The Italian, I presume?
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Enzo Molinari.
In a lake.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
How do you know that?
Then tell him to wax it too.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
You say that because you have the title!
Tea... or whiskey?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
It's too loud for me.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You'll understand.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I didn't dive.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
I brought Johana to meet you.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
In my apartment?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Coffee might be nice.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Oh. Okay.
Mordechai!
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
I'll be in my office.
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Nice fellow?
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
I don't know.
You really think so, Charlie?
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Let me see it 
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Some crazy guy.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Get it out of here!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
Yeah.
And not a sign of the leopard?
Maybe I want to feel badly.
That doesn't make sense.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
I know -- Teresa -
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
...You-you spoke to him?
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Something like that?
Dont you believe in simplicity?
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
I dont know. Everyones dead...
The dead can wait.
Crow what?
Croissants.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I know where to look.
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
What if it is?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Anything at all?
Does it matter?
Clients come and go.
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Yeah.
At what time will you be available?
Should I come back in five minutes?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Im sorry...
Should I be?
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
Fine...
I... How long have I been here?
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Three...
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Costliest!
Of course I am, it's just that...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I promise...
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
To marry you.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
Sound the retreat...
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
I leave the answer to God.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
But where are you going to be?
Not long ago...
What did it tell you?
Buying her?
If there was, I didn't see it...
His face.
Does he have hair?
Good.  Where are the English?
Yes, it's a miracle.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
No good?  This is a disaster!
No... not like this...
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
I said, kneel!
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
I might ask you the same question.
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
God asked you to do something?
Oh no?  How about this one?
Really?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really?
He'll be here soon.
Dead.
What are you doing?
Let's find out.
What's happened?
wish I knew you better.
Can you help?
Can you help us?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
A good place for what?  He's insane!
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
I've been worried sick.
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
No sound at all?
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You mean in signs?
What are they?
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
No, no cops!
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
I had some appointments.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
If we ever get to it.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
I also gotta win.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
It isn't any better.
Where you goin'?
No.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
No.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
We missed him.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Why did that man want to kill him?
It's the same one.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
There!
And I'll give then proof!
How did you ever remember me?
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
Where did you hit her?
Which way did she fall?
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
This is my wedding.
Where are you going?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Only in bad weather.
I'm very interested in that body.
What's that to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
--was Wynant's.
He telephoned me today.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I didn't know they had a fight.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
I'll get some.
Chris -- Chris -- !
So I see.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
Slim.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
All right - you didn't.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
If you like 'em like that.
That last Martini.
Yes.
Can't you get to sleep?
At breakfast.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Who gave it to you?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Huh?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I wish you'd tell me.
Why are you saying it?
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
No... no.
You his wife?
I know I left them there.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Turn the car around.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Oh, God.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Break it out.
Yeah.
Picks up again just on the other side.
Then get up and do something about it.
He...he could have been watching us.
Get out of my way.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Blow me.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Mine.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
What are they doing here?
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
Forget Wes.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
Just let me rest for a second.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Yeah, I guess we should.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
I don't know!
With what?  Against how many?
We go this way.
But...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Somebody has to.
Then I'm a rich man.
Yeah.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
I thought it would be good to know.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
What?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Correct.
You know I don't feel well.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
Who?  Who's leaving?
Incredible!
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
What's going on?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
No!....
They're not here.
Go ahead.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
No excuses, just do it!
It's from an IRA.
We've created a monster.
Maybe she knows your old man.
A ticking bomb...
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Shit. We're fucked.
Look who's talking, old man.
IRA - instant retirement account.
That feeling won't last long.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I didn't. But I had to try.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
And it had diamonds in the back.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
No!
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Constantinople?
You've never been in Constantinople?
But--
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Smart. London, eh?
Yes, Baron.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Monescu.
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Right.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
But it's not enough!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
I remember.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Peaches and cream.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Marvelous.
Good night.
Yes, I would!
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
What is it, madame?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Bollocks.
I know what ice fishing is!
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Worse I'm afraid.
If only it were that simple.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Sure. If you like.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Sssshh. Come here.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Sure!  Excuse me.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Tell me.
I'll be there--Good-by.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Thanks.
You mean that?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Good night, idiot!
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Lose?--I won a little--
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Shortie, look!
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Change?
Are you screwy?
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
On the drunk.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
I thought I put you to bed.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Meaning what?
What's the matter, Mary?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
I wish I could.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Say, "Thanks very much!"
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
"Smooth's" the word.
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
I'll explain later--
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
Yes, very.  And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
I asked where you got him.
Good.  That's real good.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
This brand.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
That's great coming from you.
A which?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
What?  But I saw 'em-
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
There's no reasoning with him.
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
How is he?
I know what it means.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Always?
Wait!
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Jack...
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Admiral, are you suggesting -
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Shhhhh...
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Gone fishing.
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
Step into my office.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
- The family jewels?
Up.
Trust me.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Next time, I do the driving.
... Yes?
And number two?
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
They're too big.
You always got something to say.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
Like muddy waters?
You were in hell?
Do you think you won?
I'm busy.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Where is Skip?
It is so considerate of you.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Here!  In the car!
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Excuse me.
Can!
I'd better take a look anyway.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Shhh!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Yeah, right.
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Look out!!
Not today!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Miss.  G-6.
No she's NOT --
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
I thought he was at summer camp!

Huh?
Right here, Woody!
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
There's not.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Didn't you know he made things?
What about school?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
You're only a young thing.
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
I finished it off.
Finn ...
Everything is gone, now.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No.
What is he being charged with?
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
That's frustrating.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Oh, it is?
I don't know.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
I don't know.
How long's the job?
You can't make me.
Yes.
I'm third in my class.
I get A's.  All A's.
Have you done your homework, honey?
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
We're playing!
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
So you pay off our customs officials?
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
You're breaking my heart.
What's he doing up here?
The police won't find your car.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Where?
We agree.
Javier Rodriguez.
What is it you want me to do?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I have money --
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
You were in my way.
Ninteen.
Ssshh!
Right. You can't sleep here.
Holding hands?
Easy for you to say.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
It's Iggy Pop.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
It's an interesting theory.
What happened?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Fuck, OK.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
It's no problem.
No.
But try too hard --
Nightmare.
Try this.
Another dab?
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
OK, so who was it, then?
You don't know, do you?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Give me the gun.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
He doubts me.
Pavel.
A Federation starship.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Understood. Kirk out.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Ah, Captain?
I've always known... I'll die alone.
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
But he does seem familiar?
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
He did have pointed ears.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

I hide no pain.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
Let's get outta here.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
You wouldn't dare.
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Probably.
Shhhhh.
Alan-One...
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
But-what if I can't...?
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Do it!
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Out.
I have a book report.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yeah, right.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Here, check these out.
Fourteen, Harry.
It can't be.
The purse is still at the house.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Here they come.
Sorry.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Uh, yes, it is important.
Okay.
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Is it working yet?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Yes.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
What about the husbands?
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Yes.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
No.  He checked out okay--
How?
He wants to speak with you.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
'Bout twelve.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
That's a long time.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
You have a pimp?
What?
You will?
Thank you.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Now tell him goodbye.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
I know.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
He trusts you?
I guess so. Follow me.
No. No you're not.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
What makes you think I would do that?
No shit?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
McTeague.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Where'd you come from?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
Absolutely.
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
- Because it's good!
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Exactly room-mates.
No.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
And your only goal is...???
Underground.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
What?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
See -- you can drive after all!
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Who am I supposed to shoot?
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
No, thank you.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
You can't do that yourself?
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Same back at you.
But, in particular?
One way, or round trip?
Thirty even.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Time.
Just a car.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
I . . .
Wrong number.
Uh-huh
There's someone in the house.
Jake.  No.  No!
Accident.
Least you can leave.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I don't know how.
Is it pretty?
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
What was I supposed to do?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Like you don't know.
Would you kill her?
No.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
That's a thick change of heart.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Christ, Jake, please--
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Give it to me!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Oh, shit!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
You broke my nose!
Say, what happened to your hand?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
And what does that make you?
I need thirteen.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
It's the truth, Jake.
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
How old are you?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
What the hell are you talking about?
So?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Eh?
I like that about me, beautiful.
That's all right.  I got it.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Thank you.
A medicine man?
Lift me down.
How do you know he's still not here?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
No! You get it!
I don't know about that?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Where to?
What kind?
Sure, I'll try.
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Wrong number.
You haven't even looked at them once.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
There's someone in the house.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Yes.
Oh.
You use your sleeve.
out again?
What was that?
I don't know Megan.
Was it serious?
You've misunderstood.
But not a knife?
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
That's great.
In the passenger car?
No.
No.
How so?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
No?
But what they done, they...
He said...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Three days? I must be.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Oh yeah.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
What's all that wood?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Yeah, I guess so.
What for?
Huh?
Well... I don't recollect.
After a ways.
Yeah, he's in there.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
First one I ever killed.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three.
Thought you was followin' me.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
You gonna share your half with him?
See that scrub oak yonder?
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We'll bury him.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Yeah.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
Goddamnit.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
You okay?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
What if I
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
You didn't know.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
You know damn well what I think.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Immunity.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Very good.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I'm on the staff of...
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
No.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I completely understand ...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Why is that?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I can't guarantee that...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
What are you going to do?
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
No.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I can't talk now.
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...one of the other nurses?
What did she do?
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
... I know.  I went ...
... I understand ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
What?
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
What did she say?
One hour.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
The Big Boy did...?
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Almost a year.
And you like it.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
She is not my wife.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
You won't have to.
Your name. And --
I told you! Right here!
Dinner... and what else?
Can I see you tomorrow?
No, it's not right.
How does it work?
No, it's all right.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
You can't. You're afraid!
Yes!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Some people prefer it.
What?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
What?
We have.
Good-bye.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Madeleine!
Have you been here before?
What?!
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
I'm here, I've got you...
All the time.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Madeleine --
Let me go! Let me go!!
Carlotta Valdes?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
What's tomorrow?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Pop Leibel.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Just wander.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
By whom?
I said how's it going?
First of all...
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
She's dead.
Playing?
It's sacrilegious.
I have plenty of friends.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You go home!
What are you talking about?
Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
What?
That is absolutely not true.
Watch the tone fella.
I can't do this.
I don't give a damn.
I know and I'm honored...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
What does that mean?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
What kind of words?
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
You have a King fantasy.
Then what do they have?
You will not screw this up.
How about my Fatburger?
I think so.
Sent it.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
He's weird.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Do you love me?
That's sweet.
Yeah. Nesting.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Who's dead?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
What money?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
Come on.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Greenpeace?
My God...
Did he try to kiss you?
That's a good one.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
The stone age.
So where to on the honeymoon?
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Was that difficult to get?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Only because you want it.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Whatever you like.
What's the matter?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Why the bad temper?
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Things seem to be getting better.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
He's lying through his ass!
Yes -- very, very big!
This louse is looking for trouble.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
I wish we could hear them.
Do me a favor  keep sending them.
I've seen worse.
Fine  you want to stay here?
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
My God...
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
As a matter of fact, it is.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Start of what?
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
You're not capable of it.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
I don't know.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
What are you saying...
...can we have a white one...?
He's not fine.
Come on.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
What rig?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Who's got the story? 
It won't hold.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
The American "people"?
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.

It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
We're locked into Albania.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...

That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,

I'm sure they do.

The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.

Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
It concerns his future!
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
How's Mom?
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
Don't start, alright.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
What if he asks where I got the money?
I don't know anything!
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Excuse me sir.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
What? How do you know about my father?
I don't understand.
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
...I can't make it tonight.
Excuse me.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Get the hell out!
Why?
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Old values. Buy.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You got it, G.G.
With Mark?
Businessman?
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
I'll come back all the time.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
I know he does.
No.  But once I heard...
That can't feel good.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Toward the end.  You remember?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
I have to go.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
You're the flower lady.
Wait!  Don't go...
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Right.  I'm sorry.
Um...sure.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
You must have been very proud.
This is...
Stop.
She's making this up.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
The planchette?
Hartford?
I don't know.
Three weeks.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
I know.
Yup.
Did she say that?
More or less.
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Hurry...
What kind of whispering?
Huh.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
It's a ghost.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Oh.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
Not personally.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's Madison Fra--
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
I never asked you to quit!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Look for antiques...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
Don't think so.
Mauduh...
MADISON!
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Then what is he...?
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Nothing was ever more false.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
'He'...?
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Yessssss...
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
- a witch.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
That's GREAT!
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
A little wine...?
No.
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
And it can't be forged?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
I have something I have to show you...
Did you?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
Get out...
I think you had better leave
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Well, Dad said...
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
But that smile.
That was code for "I like you."
You have changed since second grade.
I'm getting so good at this.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
My legacy.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
I see.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
Amen to that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Not a chance.
But absolutely true.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You better.
You promise you'll finish school?
Like what?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Tipping?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
I can't wait to see the pictures.
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Thanks.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
About Suzie?
I know you do.
I understand.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Try, Kelly.
The skinny brunette.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
You could say that.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
What about witnesses?
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
I think we just need to get wasted.
You're out of your mind.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You got something against cigarettes?
That's cop bullshit.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Put Kelly on too.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Wouldn't dream of it.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Is this leading somewhere?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Yes, me!
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Fine, I'll stop.
My friend?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
This is Colonel Richards.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
They're coming.
In an hour they're gone!
Me?
Not today, Willow.
He turned that monster into stone!
Good.  How long will it take?
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
What do I need for that?
The limitless power of...
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Just do it!
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Sorry. It's important.
John, I don't understand any of this.
I thought I was the English.
It's been a while.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Maybe.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
You have no right to keep us here.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
They kid a lot.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
You couldn't wait until morning?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
How long have I been here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Something wrong with buttons?
A real fireball.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I didn't even know about it.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
I hear you.
I'm coming.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Tight. But I'm working on him.
All right, where is he?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
To see?
If she...
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Are you all right, Dorothy?
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh!  Well....
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?
Why --
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Me?
Has it poppies on the wall....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
But you couldn't have been, could you?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh! Oh!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
Yes.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Huh?  What'd he say?
You're going to see a Wizard?
The other side....
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
It's too late!  There they....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
That's right.
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
This way!  Come on!
You don't neither --
Don't push!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Yes -- ....
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Whos she?
Makes her look even more innocent.
I was hoping you could tell me.
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
James.  It wouldnt really be...
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
The worm on the hook again.
Who did you get it from?
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Really?
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
...what?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Soon shell be everywhere.
Oh James.
Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
What do you think?
Yes.  Au revoir...
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
I would like to use the bathroom --
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
And what if youre wrong?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Yes you are.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
I think he's going to the john.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
What new information?
Am I free to go?
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Naturally.
Go to hell.
We hung out last night, remember?
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
When can I see you again?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
You don't have to do that.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
They come in any other styles or colors?
That one I'm real familiar with.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
You know, you --
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
Were you now?
He takes himself seriously.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Oh, shit.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Poppycock!
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
I did, sir.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Hello...?
You have your tickets?
Yes.
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Whatever makes you happy.
Love me?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
That's a tough choice.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Fron kon steen!
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Why did you do that?
Vermicelli.
My father was a sick man.
How old are you, young man?
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
Fron kon steen!
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
How do you do?
I thought you wanted to.
What are you doing here?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
What?
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
That's what we're paid for.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Is everything ready?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Well, this explains the music.
And look at this, Doctor!
Yes!
I know.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Of course not.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Food!
Food!!
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
