Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
You set me up.
That girl -- I --
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Her favorite uncle
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
William didn't even go to high school
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
The Partridge Family?
A soft side? Who knew?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Wait I...
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Because I like to torture you.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Say it
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Did I have anything to say about it?
He's the devil's child...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Are we going to argue?
They took everything...
I have to explore the mainland.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Say not here!  Cuba!
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
What's he doing?
Where can I meet this man?
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
But it's...
Are you married?
No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
I know.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Do you have coffee?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
A cop?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Pretty.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Alright.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Tonight.
You promise?
Okay.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Did you hear what I said?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
What is that?
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
No, I don't get that!
Emil???!
Yeah?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
What?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, I thought so.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
What is it, Hal?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Well, don't worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
CONINUED
I'm having a party tomorrow.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Hello, again.
Where's ganz?
You're done.  End of story.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Thank you.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Well?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
What?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
I lost them, that's what happened.
I didn't have the time.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
So do you...been a long day.
I'm all wet.
I guess he got the message...
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Jack, wait...
So what?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
How you doing, man?
Five bills.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You are a monster, Zorg!
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I was talking to the cat.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Hello?
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
You know how to fly this thing?
I thought you were divorced.
Apipoulai!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Not going to open?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Options.
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Mrs. Christian.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Bullshit.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
What the fuck... !
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Friend of yours?
Is that him?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
... sorry...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Something like that.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Of what sort?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Never mind how I found you.
Give me the film.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
How long you been working there?
Max.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
How old are you?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
It's their Presidential Suite.
Wha... ?
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
I don't know.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who is this... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Do you know what happened to her?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Then you saw him, too?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
It was Freddy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
What?
What is it?
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Sobering...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Then get out!
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Yeah...
Vomit?
What is it?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Unidentified Flying Objects.
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
I think you're right.
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Wonderful!
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
All ready?
That's what I said!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
That's a <u>face</u>???
Obviously.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
No.
What are you boys up to?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Guaranteed, eh?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
No, I mean whereabouts.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Do what?
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
It's fun.
No what?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Pop?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
What's the hurry?
Yeah. A few things.
On what you pay me?
What do I have to do for it?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
We should talk.
You don't mean that.
Jack doesn't need money.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Think they're alright?
How?
What happened?
Can --?
Take care, Wade.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Get some sleep.
That it wasn't an accident.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Yeah.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
Some kids were teasing you?
Yes dear?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Daddy...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
You read my mind.
I prefered the terrorists.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you know of my husband?
Yes
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
The fax machines.
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
and if that means negotiating...
Where's my family?
One.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
What are you doing, Ted?
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, what's going on?
Not now, Elaine.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Yes.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Thank you. Cream?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
George Zipp said that?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Oh, I can't stand it.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you feel all right, sir?
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Get the picture?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Who else can I ask around here?
That where Anderson worked?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Departmental policy.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
I get the picture.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Now, wait a second --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
We got problems.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Yeah.  What?
So what do I tell this guy?
Can we dream?
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is there a part for me?
What does he look like?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What did you think of the music?
No! I won't have him back.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
That's stupid.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
What?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
No. Don't answer it!
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He asked me to stay.
Where's our friend?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Upstairs.
Gertrude!
It's just a trifle, of course.
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
That's not what I hear.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Where does he work?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Are you Herr Mozart?
Sssh!
What did he say? What did he say?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Why not?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Ah!
Love, Sire!
How could I not?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How could I not?
I have come to commission work from you.
No, please.
Would you? Actually, you could.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
On the contrary.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
I regret it is not too familiar.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
What?
Are you absolutely sure?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
What? Who the devil are you?
Who is she?
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Oh, Miss Price?
He said 'Jack'.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
What did he say?
He's here.
I beg your pardon?
Call me David.
I dream of death mostly.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Hello. You all right?
I would think so.
There is only one bed.
Yes?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
The next corner we can get a cab.
But...
No.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Some, everyone does.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Go on, ask them.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I don't know. Come on.
Where are we going?
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
What?!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
I'm not listening!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Yes.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You look awful.
Thank you.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
I could hang myself.
What can we do to assist you?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Oscar, what's the matter?
I remember once when your account checked.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
What good will that do?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Well . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Helen!
You haven't got a uniform?
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Why pick on him ?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Why?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
In Cluett's office?
He was in the bank yesterday.
Are you sure?
wasn't anywhere near this place
How are you fixed?
He's smiling.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
How?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Dammit!
Which one, right or left?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
I had you covered.  From back there.
My little Web did that?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Don't care.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
A fair number, Ma.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Let me see that.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
That's what I would have done.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
I demand action.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
What is that?
On a lot of lithium?
I can't.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Why? What's wrong?
You're really serious, aren't you?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Listen, what about dinner?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Carnes? Wait.
Uh huh.
What...is...it?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Late?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
What is it?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Well...
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Where did Paul hang out?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Nothing.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Don.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Marcus?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
Isn't that -- extreme?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Look at this.
...What?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
What?!
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
You really wrote this just today?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Just thought his work should go on.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
...You wanna work -- here?
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
You know my name.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Hmm?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Thank God.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Speaking of which...
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Yes?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
There's one more thing, Austin.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
That does not compute.
What's wrong with your hand?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
How do you know?
I'm sorry.
I am not.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
That's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Quite impressive.
Dr. Evil?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
An evil vet?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
I don't want to.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
What about his teeth?
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
What do you want to do, Scott?
Seriously?
There are limits?
Knight ...
Hope...
How long have I been here?
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Then you can't come in.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
People, too.
How curious ...
I resign.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
You're mad.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Is that written in his shoe?
But
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Was I?
I could save you the trouble.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You don't trust me?
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Oh, hello ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Weather's turning nasty.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Think she really killed those agents?
Amnesia?
Why?
This man -- did you see him?
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
I was at Harrow ...
One shot -- for emergencies.
You said ... one shot.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
All right!
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
1002.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
God, you're a slob.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
A strange wang right in my palm.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Why?
Let's go.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You want to share it?
Really?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Under the table!
Rick, I'm concerned.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
What are you going to do about it?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Not likely.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Anything else?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You look great.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Hi.
Then why did you quit?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
What?
The outlets.
Where are you going?
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Who's going to die?
Fireman shit?
What's wrong?
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
You don't know him.
-- Burn them.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Yeah.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Are you all right, honey?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
Me?
Let me think about it.
Oh, really?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Ho!
Let's go niggers!
Delacroix.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
What's your name?
What do you do?
Meaning?
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Four minutes ago.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm wid it.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Nobody told me anything.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Sounds risky to me.
What is your problem?
Which one is your brother?
You've said that already.
No.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Finland.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
And what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
You can go now.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
What is the service, sir?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
I feel the ribbon.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
Good night, papa.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Can I at least have a drink?
Bill Styles...
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
That'd be my reaction too --
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
But not the only victim, right?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Maybe --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
What I said before --
That's horseshit and you know it.
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Move him.
That is the most unprofessional --
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You're off to a late start.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Little bit.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
No.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
That's not true.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
We just want --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
So?
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Bloom like a flower?
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Don.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
No.
Well, she... uh...
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
You must be Edward Bloom.
In so many words, yes.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Okay.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Am I?
Did you do any of that?
What did he say?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
You didn't become crazy.
You're not.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Was she one of your teachers?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
It's enough isn't it?
Yes. I know.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Do you believe in love?
He wants a lot of money.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I do. I want to very badly.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes neither.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Get out
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Okay. Thank you.
It's not mine.
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
My name's Sophia.
You have excellent English.
Oh! Gave me a start.
You take her to a doctor?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Let me say somethin' first...
You some kind'a pervert?
In my house, you watch that lip...
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
What'chu sayin'?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Goin' dove huntin'?
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
So...  That your first time?
Yes'sir.
I skipped lunch.
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
What?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick, we can't just --
Cool?
What does Charlie mean?
Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?
Nick!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Nick --
Nick!
A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Yes...
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Don't be an ass.
What if I chant?
Might be different in New York.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
One man.  He must be good.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Death.
I've done some questionable things.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
You're our best and only friend.
You got a machine on it yet?
Yeah.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Why, yes, of course.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
How long you had these guys?
I'm doing okay.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Too old.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Who?
The best.
Sorry.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
It would be my child.
Who is this?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Yeah.
Like?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
She didn't know?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
How do you know I'm not?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Where are your folks?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
How's that?
Over this?
Thank-Q!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
...Okay.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Yes.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
I didn't know that.
They're all divorced?
It didn't used to be that way.
Get out!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Um-hum.
Yes!
No it's not!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
I like her.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Really?
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I'm leaving, too.
But, Eve, I would--
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Yes.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Who use to own it?
When did we get it from them?
Yes. He likes windows.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
The hotel.
My father is a genius.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky?  Where?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Well, where are you --
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
You got a light, honey?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
I've noticed.
If I...you know...
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
We stay down here.
What are you bitching about now?
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Oh, yes.
Well, what do you think?
Just be yourself.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
To bed?
Or have perfect table manners.
What?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
What's wrong?
Have him committed.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What is this? What color is it?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey nothing.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
I, I don't know.
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
You don't?
I liked being with you last night.
Who is Don?
Beeeee careful.
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You called me Jeffrey.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Alright, suit yourself.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
Yes.
There ya go.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Hi Dad.
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah, how did you know?
Am I bothering you?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Alright.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Yeah, but.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
You didn't tell him about me?
No.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What? What is it?
They got nothing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Yeah, we promise.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
He got beat up by a girl.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Absolutely not.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
That was way easier than I thought.
Aye.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
So, what do we do now?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
What is it my son?
I guess not.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
He's a nigger.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
She's really kind of hot.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
But he didn't say anything.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
It's not a plan. It's just --
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
See, now we've got a plan.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I don't think we can do that.
I know.
How much?
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
What do you think?
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Do you like Inez?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Come on.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
You think Applejack knew?
Why?
You're living on a sailboat?
How?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Death.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Was Future Man adopted?
You're Anthony?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Where'd they come from?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
That never would of --
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
I paid for it.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
What the fuck possessed you?
My brother's in jail.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
What is it?
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
I couldn't hear anything.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Do you have your own cell?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Can't get it. It won't... 
There was a mistake.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Sorry to wake you.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
What do you have, Danny?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Show me again...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
Yes...
They loved you.  And I killed them.
You know I'm not.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I emptied it.
I worry when you get like this.
Where --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- not yet --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
But you found another choice.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I was here!
We need to get in there.
You're sure?
Mr. Nevins?
Me? Four years.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Do we know what this says?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We cannot defeat this --
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
No, M'lord.
You fancy him.
I'll wait... back there.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I'm dreaming.
How do you know this?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
You know the answer to that.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
I... I blacked out.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Why do you ask?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.
How. Did you. Know that?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Dad lives here?
Yes.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
Ouch.
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
It was a long time ago.
Where... where are my clothes?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Why's that?
Oh? There's proof now?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
And...?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
...yes.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Lung cancer?
Yes?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Goodnight.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
And Mademoiselle?
Occupied France?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I don't know the finish yet.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
For the last time, put them on the table.
It's been a long time.
Yes?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
How do you do?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I understand.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I believe you have a message for him?
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Even in Berlin.
Okay.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Uh, my watch stopped.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Thirsty.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Take it, damn it.
No.
What are you doing?
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
As much as anybody.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Merry Christmas eve.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I would never --
I know.
What's that?
What's that, written on the sail?
There was a coffin?
What was inside?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
What will you do?
I love you, Chuck.
When's the next Jumbo?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
Which I didn't have.
I most definitely say I am.
You're Chuck Noland.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
But I might not have.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
To Wilson.
What?
Only if you can afford it.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
These *credentials* are against the law!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Dr. Homer Wells.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
So, Mrs...
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
"...did." Well, okay.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I never said they were boring.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Uh... it's the end of October.
I don't remember.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
But she's your *daughter*...
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
That's *it*?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
They told me I was too old to serve.
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Where do you think you're going?
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
We'll take care of it.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Masters of our own destiny.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
I have a good crew.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Mr. King, I think --
Uh-huh.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Yeah.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Three years, two months. March '93.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Last hand.
Not particularly.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
Why not?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
It's the truth.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
The door, Jack.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Never. Why do you ask?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
No.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Absolutely not.
He doesn't gamble.
They mean it.
But if it does.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
You did?
I'm Lucy.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Where do you live, Jack?
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
Has he?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What the hell?
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
All right, then...
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Thanks.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Snap out of it, bomb.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
To explode, of course.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Yes.
Any planets?
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
What're you talkin' about?
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
I know.
But why can't we stay here?
Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, I'm scared.
You're a thief?
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
That would be appropriate, yes.
Yes on all counts.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
How well do you remember the lab?
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Say the words, "I understand."
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
No.
Please...
Not right now?  Okay, when?
You get it when I get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I want you on call here.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Yeah.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
No... You don't think...?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
They're not idiots.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
I said, I'm sorry!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
I did it! I did it! We won!
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Yeah, you did!
I feel bad for his family.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Theoretically.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Hey...
Where are we going?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Infant Memory Generators.
Did you call the cops?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Why? Is this about the book?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Know what?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
I asked you about school.
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Nothing.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Yes. I went to jail.
What else makes you feel regret?
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
If that's what you think is necessary.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
He was a year ahead of us?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
No more fuckin' for her.
So, what do I say?
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
I gotta work with these women.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Amber? Here.
Your parents'd kill you.
Mrs. Leeman?
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Bye mom.
What?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi...
Hi.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
My dress'll reek.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Nothin' too showy!
This is -- what?
Harold!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
My dear President...  read it back...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Here I am, Father...
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Yes, sir. 
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
I don't want him.
He only weighs ten ounces --
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Anything else? 
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
It must be done right away.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Once more! 
Yes.
Was it -- swine?
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Yes please, two.
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Don't!
I want my man back.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Good morning, Treves.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Good day...!
Oh, yes.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
I'll have to find some more.
Righteousness for his namesake.
You want a dressing bag, John?
No, he's very upset about something.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
HE'S GONE!
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
Halfdan the Black.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is there nothing men can do?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
I'll tell you what...
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
He wants to kill US!
What about the raping?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Halfdan the Black's here!
But you're the Gods!
Row!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
Do what?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
I know. I know.
Aaagh!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
What?
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Relax!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
In the room?
I'm so excited. Yay!
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I'm sure you would.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I'm Joel.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm not nuts.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
No. I --
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Yeah.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Yeah.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Let's talk about it later.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I want to know you.
I scoured the city for it.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Come up and see me... now.
Yeah?
You said...
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
What do we do?
Okay.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
So then she just stops calling.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
So what's going on, Joel?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Yeah. Cool.
Well, what should we do?
Do you swear you didn't know?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary...
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Do you like quotes, Howard?
How do you mean?
Is that Nietzsche?
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
Well, where was Patrick?
She likes you okay.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Siwash, huh?
What do you believe in then?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Where are the others?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
...do you copy?
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
Justin, finish your sweep.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
Then who the fuck are you?
You know.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Heading three-three-four...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
Come again, Skipper?
We're all here.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
What?
He's been past Mars?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Can you see a body?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
You got any coffee?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Yes.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
What the --!
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
You're on fire!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
What are you doing --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Feeling better?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What? What do you mean you --
What?
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Ben did this.
But I'm not done with the machine --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
First door on your left!
Why can't you do it?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
I don't know. I was just curious.
No.
Any problems?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Leave me alone.
Get a ride with somebody.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.
Hey, Mike?
What's going on?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Hey, Rat.
Well, I've gotta be running.
Are you Linda Barrett?
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Not coming? What happened?
But what are you going to do?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
You just ripped my card in two!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
We keep them.
Do you know what you want?
Really?
Are you ready to order here?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Killed?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Las Vegas.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
What are you talking about?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Lucy.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Read the newspapers.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Me?
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Right!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Wha?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Ohhh.
What?
Why don't you go check it out?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
But --
You wanna see, baby?
What? Really?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Bullshit.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Hey!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
I admire your strength.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
I'm not!
Okay, but come here first.
What's up?
You don't think I'm good enough?
I know, but --
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
There've been some calls.
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Fired?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
...I see.
Really?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Thank you.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Why?
Okay then...
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
What happened to him?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Oh no...
Harry... I met someone.
You're telling me.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
And?
Evening, gorgeous.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
What a man!
What's that?
Frances, You're crazy.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
You think I got it?
Mama, what's...
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Don't... talk crazy.
You're not going anywhere!
But what -- 
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
And what's that?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You drove him to his torment.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What is this?
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Have you seen Willie?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
Our decision. Together.
Victor. I love you,
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
What sort of task?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.
Are you having me on?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Melvin Belli.
Next Friday.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Good point.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
I had to.
Ow!
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
I got to.
That's thirty percent.
What was that?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Why did they block the door again?
What's this about, money?
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Yes, she is.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Now, is your shit together?
In the Winnebago.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
What?
Mexico.
What?
I'm really sorry.
Watch my back!
See ya.
-- you got your sink --
-- see this, television!
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I never said help us!
Whiskey!
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have a waterbed?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
I'm lookin' scared?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
What do you mean?
Thank you, ensign.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
I'm fine, sir.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
White House boys want a private meeting.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
"Coronado."
California.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Just a coincidence?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
So dump on me.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
What about him.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Say again, sir?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's not right.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Say again?  How many micks?
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Women.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
What?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
And you think this creature is one of them?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
What are you doing here?
Circuits are overloaded.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Wish me luck!
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
This is not the place...
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
Have them sealed off.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Somebody must have seen it.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Do I know you?
We've met before.
How do I do that?
I understand.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
You WILL go out there.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
What's happened?
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
But you don't?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Okay, now. But-
Right.
~e're alive!
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Are they behind us?
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
Closer?  I can try.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
We pretend...
Simpler.
But what if Sarris survives?
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
Excuse me?
Do your best, Tommy...
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
The army needs you.
The army can survive without me.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Wil...
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Let's not over do it...
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Unofficially, General Greene.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
What else?  From Virginia?
But, you do come from a military family?
What the hell are we doing?
You know very well who it is that I love.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
I see...
Juba was a Numidian.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Trade for what?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
What money?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
C-18.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Get in line, bro.
You're an investor, is that it?
Something shouldn't be there.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
So what's the problem?
Personally?
One we're producing.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Compass.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You've been losing.
How'd you know I was here?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
You broke in?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I think it's not horrible.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Are you going down?
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
What a spectacular view.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Smokes?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
Went aboard.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
What?!
What the hell happened!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Coffee?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
The ah... the radio's out.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
What do you think happened on this boat?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
What happened.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps? You there?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Morning.
I don't know.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
You've been out for about a day.
I thought you say Tuesday.
No, no. You got leak.
Fifteen, at the most.
You're kidding, right?
Will you get off my back for once?
Someone from the past.
YES.
Not the Maxine?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Are you going to yell at me?
Yeah, I heard about that.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
But I can't --
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Hmm.
I...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Forget it.
Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, right...
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Oh, hi...
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Hey Josh.
God, what a bunch of retards...
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Much later.
I might actually get the pasta special.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
I want to "make love" to him.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Oh yeah...
Ew ... when did you get that?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Anthony's II!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Do you want to do something tonight?
Go ahead...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
I don't believe you.
I said "great"...
It's fine.
We're not.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Oh, how "punk."
I did too!
How much is it?
NO!!!
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Jesus!
Jesus...
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
For nineteen years...
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
What? Why?
What is that?
Really?
Oh yeah?
So, what happened?
Boo!
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
In what way do you mean?
What's the matter?
Where did you get this?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Right, exactly!
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Thank you, doctor.
You were contracted to work-
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Yes he is.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
That's a terrible idea-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Don't much like them.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
I don't suppose I could watch.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
For you.
He has children?
Why so many?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
What are you working on, Egon?
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
That's where the buggy stopped.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I don't know what to do anymore.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
What is it, honey?
What are you doing up here?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Then why have you come?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Is the line sinking?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
What happened?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
No, I just thought --
Roy?  Your clock broke.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Well, let's check it out.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Out!
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Can't you tell me now?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Really!  Is it gone?
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Die in what sense?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
All right.  What is it?
Circle?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Something was definitely here.
What?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
All right.  I'll try.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
What now?
What is it?
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
That's what you told me two days ago!
If I may be so bold...
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
They won't break this one.
Where is my family?
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
The Senate too?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
What about their philosophy lessons?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
How much money is involved?
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Before they leave, get gold.
Aren't you eating?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I want to go home.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
That woman --
I'm meeting someone.
No.
Here? In Berkeley?
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Then what?
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Don't you have it on?
The marble?
What are you going to do now?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
We just can.
You really will?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Hello -- who is this?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
What did you do to her?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
A room. I'd like a room, please.
What? No. Nothing.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
How are you, Benjamin?
Thank you.
What?
Drink?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
So?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
No.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Thank you.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Did you get us a room?
Now?
Benjamin.
The number.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
You what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
On your first time --
That you're afraid --
Anything. Anything at all.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Why did you do that?
Yes.
Don't talk about Elaine?
I wish you'd tell me.
But why shouldn't I?
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
I see.
Now don't start this.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
What?
Yes, sir.
Oh no.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Mr. Robinson?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
I am not threatening you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Dad -- can you listen --
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
And what are you going to do?
No -- no -- no -- no...
You can't.
I'll pay you back.
How?
Too bad.
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
We'll dance.
That was lovely.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Go away. Who are you --?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone --
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
And?
I know.
Yes.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
What?
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
How's the beautiful lady?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Any letters?
Oh -- but -- I --
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Everything?
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I never danced before -- in public.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Moreover...
Movies?
You...
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Definitely off.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Well?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
A thousand marks -- 
Can you pay some attention to me?
Oh, yes.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Come here. 
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I mean with the Manchester people?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Let us cancel the engagement.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Four minutes past. Please come.
No news yet?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Hi, Bobo.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
You know it, Lilly.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Right in front of the room.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Not much time.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
So I heard.
Just myself.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Are you sure?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Nobody does that single-o.
I've heard the name.
Is that right?
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
You -- I don't know.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
What is it? What's going on?
Yes?
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Care to join me?
Yes.
I think someone broke into my house.
No.  Wait for the police.
My office?
What the --
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
You're twisted.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Just get on the bus.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Not me.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
It's always John.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Michael Meyers.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Keri, you all right?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I have to pee.
Better her than me.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Thanks!
Where's Shane?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
No!!!
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
No.
Um.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
I'm liable to find anything!
First Nagasaki--now this.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Our pleasure.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Fifty years?
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
For what?
What went wrong?
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Wow.
I don't know.
Go on.
Where did you get the poison?
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
It's your house, Dad.
I'm talking to you gently now.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Can I help you, sir?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
We thought it was an emergency.
Please--
A trip, you mean?
It's so--so stark.
Breakfast?
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
You're wrong.
Why not?
Two hundred years old.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
She's fine.  Please--
We have, have we?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
You hope.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Here.  Finish the job.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
What is this thing that kills me?
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Dead!
Alice is dead?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
That is sad.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
No.
He's a ghost!
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Yes, he is.
What does he say to do?
My father!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Doing what?
Yes?
I see.
A what?
How nice.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
This is very good for us.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
He's not your son.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Or get eaten alive.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
Yes, we do.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
What girls you got here?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Yeah.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
I thought you were going to bed?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Grand Rapids? Of course.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Why do you say that?
Granville?
You are.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Who made it?
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
What you got in mind?
Who told you about this?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Hold it, mister.
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Huh?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Yes.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Your tree.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Not very.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Here's your shovel.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Eh, fine.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Certainly a new experience for me.
What happened?
What?
Is he all right?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
Don't you advance on me.
You sure have a way with people.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, Harold. 
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
At a funeral.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No.
No.  I'd have liked to.
What would you say?
Jeez! That's a great story,
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Harold!
Harold!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Well... G'bye.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
hound of resurrection --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Don't look! Turn around.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
What are you trying to say?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
-- should go back. Now!
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Out? Out out?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
He's just pushy.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
What's happening?
Got her mother's looks.
Please. Get back into bed.
It's important.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
No.
This isn't happening.
Frank --
You're Julia, right?
That's right. Who are you?
But you said --
What about Larry --
What happened to you?
Who?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
So you were cheated.
And the blood let you out?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe we should just leave --
What happened?
Is it deep?
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Dead.
I got through.
You'd like the house.
Is Julia here?
I've forgotten.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I'm afraid it's true.
No you don't.
Need any help?
I'm here.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I beg your pardon?
It's not what I heard.
Your father told me you were working here.
What's wrong?
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
What?
No.  We need the gig.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Where's Rob?
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey Charlie.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I always hated this song.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
It's Vince and Justin.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Maybe I should talk to him.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I think you know that.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
So, how are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Are you still in love with me?
You don't ever think about other people?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
You know, with Ray...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Let's go home.  Okay?
What's the difference?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
About what?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
You called this morning?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
So you live in Chicago now?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So so.  Up and down.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Why not?
Tradition.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
He was innocent.
What's all that?
At least.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Yes.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
No!
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
A murder.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
Never take up poker, Detective.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Aye.
I don't know why.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
David.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
You're wrong.
Finish your prayers?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Stay out of it.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Must he go?
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Yeah.
Where!
Smith.  Carl Smith.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You've been here from the start.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
We have some unfinished business.
No.
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you know what this is?
My condolences.
Morning Mr. North
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Seventy-five.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Well, I'll try to give her one.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
The money? Why?
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Thanks...
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Now you're talking!
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Where's Bruce?
Look at me, Hildy --
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Murder, uh?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Flip a coin.
Where'd you wire him?
Sure.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
What's the dope, Sheriff?
How's everything, Gus?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Where'd you get this?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
What is it?
We'll fix that, too. 
What?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
That man there!
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Quiet, Mollie!
What's the idea?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
But how do I know...?
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
I know.
It's true.
Pauline's mum got killed.
I know a secret.
Do you know any swear words?
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Crocodiles! Aah!
But Dad, It's the News.
What's that?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
You need trees for an avenue.
Naturally.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
What's that?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
He always knows.
And where do you think you're going?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Molly!
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
I agree.
Tiny's home.
What about R.J.?
Drink up, it's party time.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
What's this?
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Keep straight on this road here.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Almost there.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Don't look back, just get in the car.
There's not enough room.
What!
What?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Why?
So what?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
No please, let me sit this one out.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
I don't hear anything.
I still don't.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Yeah, no mercy here.
God damn.
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Tell it to my daughter.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Gabrielle.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
What is wrong, my darling?
Stop. Get away.
Urgh.
That's not how he tells it.
No.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
That's what I'm counting on.
Progress!
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Really?
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Oh?
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Oh, Rosie.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Did you see that?
Come on.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
It would just be helpful to know.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Really?
That's great.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Such as what womanly things?
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
Yahoo!
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Make it twenty.
You being cute?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
That's your problem.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Why?
For me.
Hello, Eddie.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Thinking about what?
What's the matter? What happened?
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Please don't get off me now.
I got time, Bert.
Half.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
You name it, we shoot it.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
It's quiet.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
A son.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Findley.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah. You must come again.
Who's he?
Try me.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Long wait for a bus?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
So why go to college?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
I'm hungry.
What did all this stuff cost you?
Don't you ever cook anything?
I've got something in my bag.
Do you want me to go?
What's this supposed to mean?
What happened?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
I love you.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Well, what's so funny?
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Oh, grow up.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Very good shot.
I came to play pool, Fats.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
What?
You want to find them.
Humans.
Virginia...?
Is the hill ours too?
There are more this year than last.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Yes.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
What is it?
Don't go in.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
You still believe in him.
I don't know how you put up with him.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
There's good news and bad news.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Dad, please...
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
But Mr. President...
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
And our troops here?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
I'm a dancer.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Stop it.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Call them back.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Why did you people come here?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Yes.
That doesn't look much like a library.
How's the head?
Marcus!
What?
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Doctor Jones?
This.
The Grail Diary.
All I have to do is squeeze.
It is you Junior!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Will you take it easy!
What?
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
What about Marcus?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
What does that mean?
Dad?!
Where's my father?
Then we'll die.
Charming.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
What?
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Let up on the brake!
You will go to palace there.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Took what?
What?!
What's happening?
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Couldn't keep away, huh?
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I want to go home...
I can't!
No, not her. Me.
My name is AL.
Yes?
What is your name?
What street?
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Right.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
I know...it sounds insane.
Kill myself.
With a man in my head...
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Too late...They want you.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Did you hear that?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I am. You are.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
Sue them.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
...and a license to kill...
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Holy shit!
Swim.
Eat it.
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
Which language?
What did that cost?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
I don't know what's going on.
She's the toughest to read.
What if she says something important?
Is that all?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Bingo.
Just stay here and rest.
Don't touch a thing.
I can't see a thing.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
He hung us up dry.
And Dieter?
She works for them.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
You're a lucky man.
JOE What abilities...?
You just got a Mickey.
What is your name?
I knew you were trouble.
In him?
Impossible.
Me.
We'll have to let them go.
Who is your friend?
Remember what?
Well...
Take the card.
Al?
Just give me the keys.
Nothing.
What?
Then who did?
Is someone else here?
And you.
What way?
As if your mind's not all there.
Promise you what?
You talk to yourself.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Hires you for what?
Wanted to get to know you.
I'm leaving too.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Hong Kong.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
I knew it. I told him.
It was you.
What is it?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Ow?...
It will.
What's that outside, Daddy?
When's your deadline?
What? Forget it.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
You're exaggerating!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
What caliber is your gun?
That computer has everything...
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Uh, what are those boxes?
Thomas Sandefur...
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Oh, my God.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
That's right...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
So, is everything okay?
Lowell.
I disappeared on you?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
How have you liked your stay?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Hello. You there
Next to your father?
You believe that?
Excuse me. Yeah...
Good. But Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What?!
I told the truth!
What?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
You greased the rails!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Just give me an example...
Where you staying now?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Object to the form of the question!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Chapter and verse.
Well, I wouldn't say --
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
You have the pre-nup?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
How do you know?
You don't believe in it.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
No. Don't stop.
Thank you.
She never particularly cared for me.
And here I thought my mother was...
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
I know.
But?
Honey, I could sit...
Fabric and fringe.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
No buts. Now. Out.
Marylin!
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Of Massey Myerson?
Who's she?
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
What?
Well, that's about to change big time.
Yes?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Rex, please.
I don't know. I can assume...
Nothing.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
HA!
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Mr. Warne?
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
That's an evasion.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Ellie
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Ridiculous!
Fine man to fall in love with.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
You talk as if
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
We've done that already.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
What do you think you're doing!
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Yes.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Are you talking to me!
Your ego is colossal.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
Outside!
I can't go out like this.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
I refuse to resign!
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
wasbut
But what!
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
What for?
Eat a carrot.
Come on! come on! 
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
What'd you give him for the car?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Nope.
Congratulations.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
SorryI didn't mean to
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Yes.
What's the thousand bucks for?
You're drunk.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
Mebbe.
Yeahwouldn't it?
Why?
What's on your mind?
I can use a smart guy like you.
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Orange, New Jersey.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
No.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
You know you keep saying that.
What's the other name?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I did.
You know damn well who it is.
You still questioning any Cubans?
It leads farther than that.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
What do you mean?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
And then Sunday?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
No, you don't!
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
No.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What's wrong, Lou?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Jim Garrison?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Where is Banister in all this?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Virginia.
What are they?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Who was there for your ass?
How old is that machine gun shit?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
A bit.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I found out.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
But now you're telling us now you do.
Cash poor?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Somebody loan it to you?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
Why?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How do you feel about getting old?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Does something else worry you?
And Annette's it for you?
How old's Annette?
You talk them into it?
You don't actually do it that way?
He was here?
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Why?
You're rationalizing.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
What's he doing?
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Spain.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
You didn't count it?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
He said he didn't know about it.
Beaumont Livingston?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Do you got something for me?
Got some o.j.?
What do you think it is?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I do okay.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
So we need two people, two women.
Plus the same deal as before.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Where you gonna be during all this?
It's boring, isn't it?
Four years?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
Did you ever go I one?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
About five years ago.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Wanna fuck?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
What do I do?
Uh-huh.
Who was that?
Yeah.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You know how she is.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Maybe the Feds got it.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
It's in my bag.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Was she?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
That's all?
Uh-huh.
Call her, tell her the combination.
You expect me to just walk in there?
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
No.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Oh God!
Daddy. Let go.
I could have told you that.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Well, try, huh.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
There was a bang.
It's cold.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Used you?
Why do you say that?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
You think they're connected?
What can I tell you?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She hates me, Louis.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
But I see them.
Whataya mean, no record?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
It's freezing.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
I don't want to know.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
Did you look around the headboard?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
She looked good then.
Ready?
What's wrong?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
They're like demons, Jez.
We're at Della's.
Where?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Who was that?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I don't know you.
Mid-town mostly.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I would have stayed there if I could.
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
He's burning up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
For what? For seeking the truth?
He's burning up.
Where am I?
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
It's locked!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Sergeant!
The hull's imploding!
Yllo, what's your head count?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
We need weapons.
Rizzo?!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
What's this?
See? We're not so bad.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Close the fucking door!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
It's just you and me, then.
Who are you apologizing to?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
More soldiers?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
You got it?
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Older, sillier.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Michael! Come inside!
Can you do that?
Colorful, isn't he?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
My kids were on that beach...
What d'ya mean?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
You all right?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Look at him take it!
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
What can that gun of yours do?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Really? What are they like?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
What, you mean as friends?
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Can we make out now?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
Yup.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
No.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Oh.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Yeah.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Oh.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
That suits you.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Cool.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Dad, no!
I sort of already have.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
You're not listening to me.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Aw, please Junebug?
Juno, what's the matter?
What?
Like what? Be a rock star?
Have you found a place to stay?
Yeah, downtown.
You lose!
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
You dropped this.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's Early been in jail for?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
What'll we do out there?
What if they're dangerous?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
What the hell is this stuff?
This the book your writing?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
If you say so.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Why?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Who said he's my good buddy?
How do you know that?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
What's that?
Brian I want him out of our car!
Why, what did he do?
Any word from that gallery?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Could be.
Where would we find him?
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Well, how was it?
Did what take?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
What do you mean?
You think?
Probably.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
The cartoon?
I hate this game.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
That.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
You are?
Casper, where's Telly.
Where you at?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
At the block party?
What do I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Yeah, I guess so.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Wish me luck.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Yeah.
Casual.
You are!  I don't like you.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
He's not talking about himself.
Local?
You think he's dirty?
How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
To get your attention.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Because she's the type.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
It's me you want.  Not her.
You don't understand.
Nope.  Nothing.
I just can't believe it.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
He was watching you.
You must be Erica.
Do you like my dad?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Six, eight hours tops.
You mean, no prints but hers?
That's great.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
We're not sure.
And this Jeremy--
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Are we going to go through this again?
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
Peter...
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
It is.
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
Let's change the subject.
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know you didn't
She died in a car accident.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Well, you're beautiful.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Will your power outward.
In the Arctic ice.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I have no extraordinary powers.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
They know when they're going to die?
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
But you suspect.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
You're coming with us.
Slayers!
You have done it?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I ache with it.
Well, I'm not impressed.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
You!
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
We meant only to please you.
And do you think I live on air?
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
What news from our friends?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
A match for your son, I think.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
What's that man's name?
Do you need money?
Take...
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
What shall we do?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Nothing, for the moment.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
But... He works for your same employer?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Here comes the resume.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
You do?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Yes?
Ellen?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Then why?
I do love you... very, very much.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
I want children.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Your father?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
Pacifica, California.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Not our problem.
Is that right?
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
That's me.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
I'm walking there Kris.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She knew you loved her.
Tom Joad?
What, come on?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
In a hospital.
What do you want?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
What do you think I should get?
Hello.
Sarah -- with an H?
I guess I do too.
I sometimes fade out.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Sera...
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Where are you staying?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I've been all right.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Are we done for today?
No.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
So everything you just said --
What's going on?
What?
Uh -- both?
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
No!
That's terrible!
Is she?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Really?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Picking out my wedding dress!
She's not!
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Whoa -- Why?
So now you're -- ?
Up for a celebration dinner?
It's pink.
Amazing how?
Maybe she found him like that.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Then what? My boobs are too big?
C'mon. Let me take you home.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
You got into Harvard Law?
Pink ones.
Are you serious?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Hovering?
Fool's magic.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You go to lady now?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Grotesque... monstrous...
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
And then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
I don't expect you'd understand.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
And, now?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
No, wait... please... listen...
Enough!
No... I... I need to rest.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
The colt's still too small.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Aye!  That too.
We must follow that bird.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Beware.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
This is ogre's magic.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Certainly understandable.
God's blessing.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Sunlight, you say?
He'll not escape me.
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Go on... go on...
I'll try.
Well done, lad.
You promised!
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
Sport, indeed.
Oh, dear.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
They rival the angels of paradise.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
I thought you were dead... I --
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Not very precise directions.
Ask away, sweet man.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
I'd be honored.
Wondrously so.
Praise be to God.
Uhm... fine work.
Lost?
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
And why was the alarm on?
He seems lonely.
Alyssa.
You're a good girl.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
We're not gonna do anything.
I thought I was helping you.
You hate your father.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
This is such a street of whiners.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I've been here twenty years.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Hello?
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
You don't have a choice.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
I'll hate you forever.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
No one would blame me if I left!
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
A friend of yours is here.
You're too fucking late.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
She seemed upset.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
She needs to be alone, I think.
What?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Why would they tow your truck?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Hey, hey!
I can't leave the house?
I did say he could go.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
Where's Sam?
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I didn't think you'd come today.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
His father is a man.
The biggest waste of time since television.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
Despite you.
Sam took them to a movie.
Can you stay for dinner?
I don't know what I'm doing.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Nagger?
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
You know I trust you, Claude.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Why didn't you take it?
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
You're soft.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
So?
What does that mean?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
I said you're soft.
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
Crop duster.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
What?!
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
What is that?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Move it out.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Is everyone here?
It'll be too late.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
No!
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
This is bad, Nicky.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Bus?
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Good idea... kill me.
Hello.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Where do you think we came from?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
That was a great shot you made.
What's going on, Logan?!
It has nothing to do with you.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
What's wrong, Available?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Jessica.
And?
I changed my mind.
About what?
I'm listening.
K.
You could have called me yourself.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
I don't have much time.
Are you here to help me?
I'd rather be with you.
But what is this -- why?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
I -- I can't.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And Sanctuary?
What does that water do?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
What's that?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Goodbye.
Yes...
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
No.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
As best we can.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
It's me...
Pete?
I don't know.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Yes, I believe so.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Have you made any charges against him?
Where's Pete?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
You just gonna let him go?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
I wouldn't know how.
When he went to work, right.
Who is it?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
No.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
There's no other bedroom?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
My... My head.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What's that? Another tape?
They're gonna cook him.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
At sixty?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Okay.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
A paleontologist.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Well, what do you know about that!
Uh-huh.
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Will you stop squawking!
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Yeah. You know.
There you are!
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
It's unbelievable.
And mine's Conway.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Oh George, come on.
Well - I mean
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What was that?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
What is?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
I was just going to.
Go? Where?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Thank you.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
They don't?
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
I wasn't scared...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
What?
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
what's this?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Jesus Christ...
What if he's telling the truth?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
It's marble.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Why not?
What is it?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What the hell does that mean?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Nowhere.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Yeah?  What's up?
Agatha --
No.  Follow him.
He's here.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
That's comforting.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
Hence the expression...
Don't worry, Lamar.
Uh-huh...
I understand.  What's the other thing?
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Seventeen minutes.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
No maglev system.
Go ahead.
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Sir?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Sean, wait...
You're not gonna kill me?
The precogs were wrong.
You don't seem all that proud.
Heal who?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
What?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
This your work?
We used to, every summer.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
But John was with him at the pool?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
No thank you.
Yes, sir.
Not on me, sir.
So?
What, sir?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
It's on West Broadway.
Manhattan.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
I know.
Ricky's not wearing one.
No.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Who's watching the baby?
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Max offered to stake me.
5-5-1.
You driving her?
Yeah.
How bad is it?
What's that?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Yeah. Sorry.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Where's the drop?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
It's important.
What about it?
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I thought you hate that club.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
How'd you unlock my phone?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
What? Did she say something?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
I don't know.
Where do you think you're going?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Cool. See you later.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
No shit?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
What about my keys?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
No...
Yeah.
Dip?
Is your papa West Indian?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Let Billie finish.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
I sure met some.
I don't know how.
Do you?
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
What?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
Yes.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Shhh!
Dear heart, I love you.
Let some of us come down there.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Let's cancel.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Please, go ahead.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
What mission?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Let me die then.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Fine as May wine.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
They talked about me like
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
[What money?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[How much do you want?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And?]
[Yes. Many times.]
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
You did something on impulse?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Why not?
We're taking a different way home.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It hurts.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
The blocks.
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
You're American.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Sorry.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I don't believe you.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
She likes him.
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
[Is that good or bad?]
[I know this. Your point?]
Two tourists who never went home.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Where?
You want me to ride down with you?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
It's her baby too, you know.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Ah?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Yes, I know.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
We just live one flight up.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
You say something?
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
What time is it?
Sure, what?
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
What, Ma?
I said, is she Italian girl?
...and they sit down right next to me...
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Stop him! Stop that man!
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
What's that?
Never heard of him.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Give us this day our daily...
A football game?
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I think I heard about that.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Radar!
C-A-M-E-M...?
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
You think he won't.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
You can cut the bow.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, get out of here!
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
What's that, Henry?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
How is he?
Nice.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Against anything. Just protest.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
That's good.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
What letter?
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Had any schooling?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Did you find her?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Boss.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
St-rike!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Sure.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Yes! I was paid! But the
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
Uh-huh.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Where's the stereo?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Who is it?
Where did you find an old recording like that?
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
Hold on a second here.
I what?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
You'd never been out of New York?
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
You living together?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Get good at it.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
I'm just practicing my lying.
We lost.
How much you wanna bet?
And what about the ones you don't save?
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Yeah?
Scott...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
You let us worry about that.
I'll provide you with transportation.
Any verification on numbers.
God-Damn you!
It's okay.
She said I have a son...
You were right.
But this is impossible.
You were the one who was dying.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
What?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Why?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
I've got to get back.
You went to my high-school?
Then how do you know about --
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
Sorry?!
Program name?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
What?!
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
NEW POWER COINS!!
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Here you go!  No pushing!
And how do we do that?
Hey, boss!
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
Simon says...
What is THAT!
I am the mighty ape!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
The goddamned bastards.
Up here, Boss.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Same here.
It's a mask.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Meyer.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like a party for all our friends.
Like Don Maranzano.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Come off it, Bugs.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
The Big Picture.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Luciano is dead?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
What's the matter?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Monkeybone...!?
Bitchin' good cake.
You're acting kind of...odd.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
Can't you give it to me later?
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
You want to come inside?
... What are they all doing there?
How are you doing sweetheart?
He seemed quite taken with you.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
You mean it's dangerous?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Looks like it, but--
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Yeah. Funny--
Tunnel?
Have *you*?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Y-yes, Jim.
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
Jeff for Senator.
Washington!
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Where were you?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Well--goodnight.
Mr. President! A point of order!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Whose statue is that?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Committee.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
The Steering Committee.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Lena.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
You--don't know it, do you?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
What you *have* to do is fight!
Hurray!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Oh--you are!
Well! You don't say!
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Ax?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Chick--
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Go away, Nosey.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yes--
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Do I actually *see* this--?
No. Are you?
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Are they true!
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Sure. I met you.
What did they say?
Have you seen the papers?
He did? I play the tuba
What did he play?
No. It's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Good night.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
How'd you get the picture?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
How is this, sir?
Come on, John. What happened?
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Yes. That is to say
Why not? Who is he?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Huh?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
No.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
That ought to be fun.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Tails tonight, sir?
What do you think you're doing?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
I'm fine.
But you do therapy?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Stop now.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
...And?
Where am I supposed to eat?
Okay.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
No.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
So whose route is this?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
You're upset.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Transference.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Uh-huh.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Jerking off?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
That'd be Lily.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
That was a terrible thing.
Yes... your particular approach.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
You will not believe it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
And what did he say?
You lie.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
No, I mean --
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Got it!
You lied to me!
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
None taken.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
You did not!?... We're not!?
I knew you'd know.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Thanks.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Hi.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
But there's still only six of us.
I can't.
Or flowers.
What's that?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Wow.
Really?
Ow.
I use it... to fight evil.
And there's the Sphinx.
And a social life.
Through there!
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
I'm not insulted.
And where is the army?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know, sire.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Bertrand, sire.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Ah-hh, no.
When did it start?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
When is she supposed to return?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were any of them married?
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I will never forgive you.
Yes -- what is it?
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Five minutes.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Why did you give it to him?
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
You mean you heard them making love?
That is a matter of opinion.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
A message from Citizen Fouche.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Well, let me in.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
You know what he mean, dude.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Me neither.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
That's the sister.
So.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
What's the matter?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
You're welcome, Unc.
Delivery!
I don't play for no team.
Smokin' what?
What kind of activity?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
What it say?
And some rolling papers.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Just do it.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
What's the matter?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Where to, sir?
Uh, yes..
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
No.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
For what?
Daddy?
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
How should I...?
Don't you threaten me.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'm just an accountant.
I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
What?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Yeah.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
Put her on.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Don't!
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
I'll light the lamp.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Walt!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Is he hit pretty bad?
What can we do, Mother?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Tricked us!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
There's something else.
Why?
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Hm?
Dead.
Huh?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right boy: where's the money?
Now: Where?
I'll tell you a secret.
Now it's your turn.
Can I have my supper please?
Why, pray tell?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
I -- no, I --
Where's she at?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Slept like a rock.
You believe in anything?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Hello?
Hi.
What?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Great
I must be going nuts...
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Give me the key, mother.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
What you mean 'all at once'?
Rod says the sweetest things.
What you dream?
From Leon.
Aren't you late?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I have nothing to hide.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
An evening gown.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
How are things in Moscow?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
The Duchess...
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Good evening, Your Highness.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
We can call our ambassador.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.
A week?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Bad news?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
That's even better.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
We did our best, Comrade.
...and Kopalski.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Business.
Private.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
No visa.
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Can I help you?
You might hold this for me.
How long does it take a man to land?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Thank you.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
You repeat yourself.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
I didn't follow you.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
On which boat?
No.
I don't think so.
No.
Yes.
I don't look too foolish?
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
How do you do?
No! No!
Would that make you any happier?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
They belong to the people.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Did you win?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Thank you.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
No thanks, Swana.
Yes.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
I must ask you to leave.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Where to, madame?
Where do you eat?
So ... let's go ...
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
I figured that out.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
He wants money.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Sorry ...
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
The army?
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
I can't ...
What'd you say?
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
And me? ...
What?
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Thank you for coming, Dick.
You'll win the nomination.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Kissinger?
How the fuck did you know?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Uh, wait ...
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Bernstein.
Sir?
No, sir ...
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
I know ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
Amen to that.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Is that the truth?
You don't have to go.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
I don't want them to love me.
This.  Above all.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
He looked old, didn't he?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
They're all your enemies?
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Tomorrow.
You.  What' you're doing --
They were for me.  They're mine.
It'll be over soon.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Some say you are, Rocky.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How you been, Ellis?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I'm... discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Uh-huh.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
You ain't heard from him?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Yes ma'am?
The old boy shot by the highway?
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Probably must be.
No sir.
You gonna drive out there?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
I always am.
I can't plan your day.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
No. But I gave my word.
To your husband.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Just keep it up.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Why would I care where you're going.
You know she won't be there.
Yes.
With what?
Will there be anything else?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yes I do.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
When did you last see him.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Okay. We can stop that.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Another additional.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
How would you describe him?
The heroin. You don't have it.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Junior year!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
I know that...
Little place called "Williams," why?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I'd rather not...
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Yes, ma'am.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Umm... yes. Back home.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Lyla's very nice.
Yes, she is.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Didn't I?
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Ad lib?
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
...well, then you ain't got much.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Los Angeles, California.
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Like Rome?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
The one you were telling me about?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Guess who I saw today.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Huh?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Now, that's really stupid.
...among others.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
What?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Wesley...
Who's this?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
I said 'got it?'
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
...and how long did she work here?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
I see.  May I?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Hmm?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Would you say she was ambitious?
David Ravell.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
- and share one of your graves.
It ain't the law!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Devil his due.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
You said -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You didn't know that at the time!
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Come back here, kid!
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I want to fly, sir!
No, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
You serious about having him over?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
God help you, Lynette!
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Does it still hurt?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
God.
She's gonna handle it.
Get the fuck away from me.
They're not supposed to be here!
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Hey.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
We're leaving.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
What?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Can't hear a thing.
What if they get in here?
Feel okay?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I am.  I'm here.
Uh uh.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Stop it.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Tyrone...
Oh shit Alma... you're...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
So... we understand each other Judge?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Yeah... whatever you say.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who's they?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yes sir, I did.
We're working on that...
You mean...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Alone...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
What are you saying?
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Motherfuckers...
This cool the heat off you any?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Late summer.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
You don't know him very well, do you?
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Do you?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Probably.
You know how old I am.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
It is ended.
Don't worry.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Is he really all right?
Ellie? What's wrong?
Ellie--
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Was it Pascow?
You need a glass?
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
Yes, but--
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
Whose burying ground?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
It's Ellie's cat.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
My God!
I got eggs down here!
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
What's in your head, boy?
Elizabeth goes free!
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
What?
That would hardly be proper.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You cheated.
Move!
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed.
It's still against the law.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
On what?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
... no.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
How long do you leave him in there?
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
No, thank you.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Where did he go?
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Like Crazy Glue?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Been out for six months now.
Same old Daniel.
It already is.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
... just like the mouse.
You don't know?
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
What are these?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
Look at this!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
What in the...?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
I remember I was trying to help...
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Icky!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
I think I better go, Stew.
Certainly. Right over there.
Really?
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Of course I am Stewart.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I see.
Stewart!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
This way.
Thank you very much.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Yeah?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Gloria Golden?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Not since you broke into society.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
No.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Traps shut!
Thanks. May I sit down?
She did?
We just thought that
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Double-strength!
Are the cars ready?
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
I beg your pardon?
And you struck him right here in our house?
Me, sir?
Well, sir, I putter.
What do you mean?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
What?
She's crying.
It is?
It's six-thirty ...
Don't! Just let go.
I don't believe it.
That's not going to happen!
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Are you alright?  What is it?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
And where's that?
Mr. Simpson ...
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Get lost!
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Can we do any better?
No way.
Jen please ...
It's okay.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
You're reading?
So what is it?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
That was sure swell ...
Mmmmgh.
Rain.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
... What's that?
It's an art book.
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Cool.
No, no, no.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
What city?
Hello.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Yeah I can't.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Hello, this is Back.
Where are you?
I'm in my bedroom.
No.
Are your pants off?
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yeah.
-- you said you did.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
This is not cool.
I have to go.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
No.
They're not open yet?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
Really?
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
....yeah....
What did he want?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
It's Barry.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
For work.....
Can I come home with you when we get there?
It's ok to ask that.
Ok.
Yeah.
I cut myself.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Hello, how are you?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your name?
No one will know your name.
Who is this?
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Yes I'm fine.
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
You're goin' on a trip?
What's up?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I won't.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Put him through.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
We should be going --
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
He did seem a little strange.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
By whom? The Marquis?
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
Enough to discern its tenor.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
It's a formality; truly.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Do you favor its publication?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
And place my reputation at stake?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I have.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
But I am history.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
"A habitu of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Go on, child.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
I pray you: be succinct.
And I in yours.
How was I to know, my darling?
You've come to lecture me?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Ever met Walter Winchell?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
I wonder sometimes.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Sure you can, just--
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Do you?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Why is that, Louis?
There. That's right.
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
I wanna see the picture today
Can I talk to Hearst?
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Forget it-
Showing life
Manolete?!
Jesus
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Yes.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Don't do this
Let me out.
Fuck you--
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
Hedy Lamarr?
It's too late. The movie's made
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
What have I done?
Oh God.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You talked to New York?
CITIZEN KANE
Pardon?
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
They've all seen a rough cut
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Hey champ!
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Hit me in the face.
Jack, I got no gloves.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
So what?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
Nine o'clock.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Take off my pants.
Jake...
I was just...
You're not interested in him?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
I never noticed his face.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Where you been all day?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
What?
Why don't you just call him?
But they don't have a case against you.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Thanks.
Who said they left then?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Give him evidence.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Where?
Read some good books.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Jeff --
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Can you get me that ring back?
I can't. The police have it by now.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
That's normal.
People have different emotional levels that --
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
No.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
It is something really important, Jeff?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Three.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Don't you ever have any problems?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Nothing, thank heaven.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What about it?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Inside stuff?
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
The same.
What's that?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Just him.
What you say your name was?
Hi.
Sure.  It's fine.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
What time is it?
You still want to go home, Moose?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Have some cigars.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Are you going down there?
What's your name!
I know.  That's why I came back.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Isn't he schizoid?
I don't want you for my father!
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
You sure?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
'Bye, Mom.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Mom--I'm not--
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
I don't know why--!
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
He called me chicken.
Now that's true!
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
The kids take me.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I'm never going back.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Plato, where's your father now?
Hi, Plato!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Must have a way with stationery.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Searching for a money man...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Negative five?
Yeah.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No, hey, I like your coat --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Where the hell are you going?
Beauty and fragrances.
Nick, I love you --
He'll kill you.
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
They'll have guns.
I saved your life.
You shouldn't have.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You said it a million times!
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
You got one hour.
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No gun.
Ash?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
You want that for here or to go?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
You knew there were guns in here!
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
She's using a new perfume.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Just a roach, Zook.
Alamo...
Do what?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
You gave them me.
Start talkin
Alone at last.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
You ain't dying, he is.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
What's this?
What?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Like hell I am.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
You do?
Your name's Freddy something.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
I'm cool.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Coffee?
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Why do you think?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
How does she draw?
What was he in jail for?
Yes.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
Yeah, how did you know?
I can't take her with me.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
That something I shouldn't see?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
He certainly could. About a month.
How far up the trail?
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Oh my God! We're dead!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Ray, run faster.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Cindy, let me...
Then what are we going to do?
Are you okay?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
It was you...
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Professor!
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Yours, or the turkeys?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
How is she?
Would you like to see the girl?
Father, are you okay?
Yes.
"Ray!"
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Hi, Mom.
You said you hated him.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
Don't I get a kiss?
Oohhhh, Eugene!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
I beg your pardon?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
I certainly was not!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Man, that one made me puke!
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Which room is it?
Yes, I understand.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Why?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
But I'm not joking.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
I have been at the library.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I can imagine.
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
I have to go -
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
But why come to me?
What was she to you?
Uhhuh.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me what?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Would they hurt her?
One believes - it's like any other religion...
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
But she was here?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
That was quick.
Well...
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Sister older or younger?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Are you in the middle of something?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna?
All of these are interviews?
Maybe you want to go.
Why not?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
What will you do when the money runs out?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
Don't you get lonely?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Possibly.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Who'd you have lunch with?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
But I'm not.
I have thought about it, yes.
What upsets you about that?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
That you are under no obligation to me?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Why, so you can go after him?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
I have a pretty good idea.
And what?
I just thought it might --
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
I wanted him to see me.
No, but I did.
I feel like I do.
It's a sun dress.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
I just want to know why you're here.
She didn't give you my address?
About what?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Yes.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Yes.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Could be risky.
Not today. I've got other plans.
John Millaney.
When?
Hello.
Cynthia. John.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It won't. I trust him.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
God, you... you're mean.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
IBM.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Another kiss?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Yes? Who is there?
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
Did I say anything?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
Yes?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
How's Brad?
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
About Brad's family?
I know, I know, it's just...
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
I'll leave you young things to it.
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
F for...
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
My condolences.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
No, I'm an actor.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I can't help the traffic.
You said you had it all lined up.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
That's your problem, Miles.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Huh.
That's what you do with every one.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Yeah. Tight.
How do you know?
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
What do you think?
Where were you?
Understanding of what?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Nope.
Nice shot.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
I said okay?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
You know what I'm thinking?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Victoria.
Ken.
That's great.
How much skin and stem contact?
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
It makes me feel better.
A hair.
This one?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Hi sweetie.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Just make noises then.
No I'm not.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Where are you going?
Should we turn off the lights?
We won't be able to get out of there.
It's getting stronger.
They're broadcasting...
How many died?
That's good enough for me.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
I don't think so.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
What book!
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
I didn't know you were out.
Forget it.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
I almost didn't.
More than enough.
Goodbye?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
They got a saloon there?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
You own this land.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Why?
We didn't get that far.
This a friend of yours?
You wanted to see me?
You can't do this.
That ain't right.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
You're kidding.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
What brings you into my saloon?
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
You really are a gambler.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- It's called a projector.
Spare me.
You're not renewing my contract.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Where is she?
I can't wait to meet her.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
I'll send you her resume.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Better late than never.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Where are you?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Yes, call me Simone.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
There's... a wall between you --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
She still with Kent?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Good-night, Daddy.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
The background is.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Thank you.
Hi.
Let's take it down a notch.
--My God.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Don't step in the horse manure.
I forgot your name.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
What?
Can I ask you then?
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes, it did.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
I wish I were somewhere else.
What?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Cole, please stop.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
I don't know how else to look--
Witch.
Someone actually... employs you?
I happen to be a professional.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
"With a hack-hack here --"
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
How... was she "called?"
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
What's wrong?
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
About what?
So?
Suzie... No.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Like what?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Rorschach.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Hey there, Chief.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
You.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
How much style?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Having fun.
Can I ask you something?
What the hell are you doing?!?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
And?
No what?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Liquid gold.
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Never mind. It's nothing.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
What about the sheriff's task force?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Mortal.
Did he give you his name?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Who?
You're sure?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
You woulda?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Are you on a land line?
That's not possible. I told you.
So I guess you're not going.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
About what?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
What's wrong?
I want to hear your version.
Listen --
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How much sleep?
I don't know.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Just get him to stop.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
What do you remember?
What do you mean?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
I can't stay here.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
You want it coming back with us?
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Hi.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I'm supposed to call in.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Didn't do very well, did you?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Could be, I guess.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Where?
When can I see you?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Do you?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
It wouldn't work.
Claire!
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Nothing.
Mike?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
You got no idea...
For how long?
I can still use a gun.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I'd identify him.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Mike, take it easy...
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What about when she goes out?
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
... Hard?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Nice threads Dad.
She's what?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Oh, sure.
I know.
I was there.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Mr. Jameson--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Some things you should say anyway.
Good morning, Liz.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
My my.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Some prep school thing.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I will finish what I've begun
I heard about Thorkel's order--
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Need any more help?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
There's only one pair left.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
And maybe a little something else?
You make my mouth water.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Jawohl?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
Let me go!
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
So what? There's other women!
You did?
That's what I wanna hear.
Grable, not Gable!
You're crying, Animal.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You did!
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are you questioning me?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
That is my wife.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
You heard him.
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
It's working.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Captain=8A
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Data, are you all right?
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
I thought you might.
Aye.
Kirk here.
Is there a problem?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Doctor Soran?
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Aye, sir.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Will we get another ship?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Locate.
David... Sorry I'm late.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
This planet is aging in surges.
I don't understand.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Saavik... Is... David with you?
I know you... Do I not?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Yours...?!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me your hand and we both live.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What about Spock?
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
How is that...?
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Khan could be down there!
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
You did this -- in a day?!
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
David. Please.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Well done, Commander.
It's the Genesis Wave!
I didn't expect anything.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
The Admiral's son.
Let them eat static.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Give the word, Admiral.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
A distinct possibility.
What IS working around here?
Uh oh.
Spock...!
I failed to resolve the situation.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
That was close --
All stop, sir.
Time!
Understood, sir.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
You do this -- for friendship?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Now wait just a damn minute.
We've done it before.
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
Wake up, man, wake up!
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
That is what I said, Doctor.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
We're just -- observing.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Damage report!
You play games with me and you're through
Shields, aye.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Memory problems, too.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
What do you mean now?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock...?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Admiral! There be whales here!
No power to the bay doors.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
I am well, Admiral.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Professor Scott, if you'll --
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
Don't panic...
But not you.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Data doesn't breathe.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Incomplete, I might add.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Do you know how they were damaged?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Options?
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
Worf to Picard...
No, sir...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
You actually performed surgery...?
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
No. I will not betray my friends.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Can you configure it?
I have helm control.
What year is it?
Did you know her?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
No... the door's too thick.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
You're lying.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Friends from Cornell...
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Why?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Captain...?
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Are you alright?
Wil... Data was down there.
What are you suggesting?
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I believe the operation is over.
Or not to be -
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
They'll make it look like an accident...
They'll respect him now...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
Are those your words?
Spoken by you?
From Starfleet?
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
I know how to get outside the shield.
I hope you're happy.
Sir?
Never been this close.
Captain...
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Captain --
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Sir?
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
And if they're still in place?
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
What do you imagine this is?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We are being hailed.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
This isn't real.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.

Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And the Senate supports you?
You know I need to verify this.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
How did you end up on Remus?
You don't trust me.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
You're not Reman.
Why are you here?
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I don't know.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Report!
What about Picard?
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
He's a very unusual android.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
The bond is broken.
How long?
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
What do you think of America?
Recognize this?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
Marc Shermin.
Steering wheel.
Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Smile.
What?
Shit.
A drink.
I...
Sun...
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Eh... yes...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
Nobody knows.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
I feel better if I move.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
You're damn right I am.
What?
You don't forget anything, do you?
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Tell him I'm not here.
Very beautiful country up here...
No, sir. Radar.
Where are you going?
Judy, that's stupid.
You know that's impossible!
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Who did it?
We should talk alone.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
Clips.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Looks like she was holding out.
Whattya mean?
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
So that gives you something.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Who's Strickland?
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
You see Tran?
Take it to him.
See you downtown.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
No, sir.
Agent Mackelway.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
You heard?
You have the body?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
You must travel a lot, huh?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
At the field office.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Why did you go to Chicago?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Not especially.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
"Gone live?"
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Just routine stuff.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Start killing people for real?
And you're working with him?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
You okay?
It's quite advanced.
Agent...
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
No weapon.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Maybe you should back off.
Is he dead?
Let's talk about Zero.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
I don't...
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Thanks.
Nikki.
I'm Mike.
...not until you book it...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
A couple of high rollers like you?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
Listen. I had a great time.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Yeah.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
Well that sucks.
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
It's a gig.
Kinda.
I do. Good for you, man.
How many strokes?
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah, there's the rub...
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
You miss the pain?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
What's he do?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Did she, or did she not smile?
We're gonna get laid, baby.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
That was so demeaning...
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
She likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
Nice, baby.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Yeah, a good friend.
How?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Who? Rob?
You looked right at her, baby.
What a surprise...
That was pretty cold, dude.
...You're just poking at it...
Be smart about it.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
I ask for Justice.
Godfather.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Eat it, it's on the table.
You heard about your father?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You take care of your family?
Should I bring him in.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Yes.
Barzini.
I'm going to finish school.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I'll need him.
Barzini will move against you first.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
You tell us about America.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
They're talking to themselves.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You really want to know?
Al Capone!
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Sure.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
He'll be OK.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Don't you want dinner first?
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
To the city.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
A million times.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Do you wish to be baptized?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Is he alive?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Marge, you like everybody.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
You like jazz!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
What?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Relax.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
What are you talking about?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Are you okay?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
What's your secret?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
I know.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You're kidding.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
A ragione. A ragione. 
I can't later.
I'm fine.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
What do you want to change about this moment?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
November, I thought.
November 7th is my information.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Thank you.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Yeah.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
How long has he been there?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
That's a nice name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I musta been stoned.
Well, I tried.
Can I see you again?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
He looks like a killer.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
What's so important?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I sure hate to go alone...
Why should it be grounded?
Why, thank you Travis.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
There's porno theatres for that.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Why do you ask?
Who?
O.K., cowboy.
Wiz?
Yeah?
Well, I just, you know...
It happens.
The taxi life, you mean.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
God's speed.
You'll stand by me?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
I see you got the telegram.
... including me.  Right?  
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
My what?
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
I see...
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
No, sir.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
A super market.  Huh.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Dad, I...
The film broke...
Did I what?
What.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Any idea how you got here, son?
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
I can play the piano?
No.
Cat.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
I thought you...
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Thank you.
I suspected as much.
What do you mean?
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
She already has a daughter.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
No!
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
That's where the Brenners live.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know, Mother.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
But they'll be back.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I started to say... inside...
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
He's not home.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
What?
No, of course not.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Ahhh, but I know you.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
What made it...
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Yes?
You like me, huh?
Can't see a thing.
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
I'm sure.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
No.
Helping travelers.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
You look a little shaken.
Are you staying?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear!
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie...
Have we still got power?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
We need them.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Of course.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
No.
What?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I've had some experience.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
But what makes a thought start?
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Where are they? Last chance.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Where is it? This place?
You killed her. I saw it.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Yeah, no kidding.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Someone else did it.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
How about sign of a big black bird?
An accident, Nathan.
Erin!
No.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Tell me what?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No foolin'? Will you?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Well, we could--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
You hold great hope for this meeting.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Hey, take it easy.
Look.
You can't kill me, Star.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Thanks, Grandpa...
Good!
Are we havin' fun or what?
Did we have a date tonight?
He looks dead.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
No.  I'm up.
What's that smell?
You've heard this story before?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
-- a job.
Not impressed, are you?
I know, I've felt it...
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Nanook...
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Sixteen.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
So what's our problem?
Anybody sick?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
MacReady!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
What are you doing?
What for?
We should have jumped his ass.
Spaceship of some kind.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Anything?
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
How many in their party?
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
What kind of test?
Where was he trying to go?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
You hear that?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Say I just come back again?
A man can change his history.
No...
I don't think that's going to happen.
It's spectacular...
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
What?
Alex, what is it?
Alex...?!
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
I've been working.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
For God's Sake, David --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
Why don't you come to our house instead?
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
His curiosity is amazing.
Why not?
You can see so many here.
Every night.
I can see Kalen's point.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Kalen...
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
If I might explain, sir --
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Then don't.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
That's too bad.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
Did you know my father?
That's too bad.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
What should they be looking for?
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Why?
[Beat] What?
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Why, what would you do?
No. I don't want it to.
What case?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
What about the world?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
You know how to get there?
I wasn't talking about anything.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Becker does? Are you sure?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
I'm not sure.
Why "of course"?
What's this?
[Beat] I do it.
Well, good for you.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Uh-huh.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
In the leg.
Who do you think did it?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
We're both fine.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
A .38.
Stop.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Louise, is that you?
I'm a robber.
How?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
I'm cash poor.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You're not touchin' that car.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
But you think he fools around.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Just past Boise City.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
He said they're charging us with murder.
You awake?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Why?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Never?
Well... at least now you know.
No You mean...?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Dom? What are you?
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Oh yeah.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
By the way, what's your name?
I beg your pardon?
No, I mean
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
So...
Come on, what were you going to say?
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
You want her dead, don't you?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
What are you doing?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
What do you mean?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I see where you're going.
No I'm not.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Magda!
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
What...?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Now by killer, you mean...?
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Ho there.
Oh God.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Hey.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Starshells.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
I'll do it.
What does the letter say?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Slow down. Smell that?
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Still heading for Cuba.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Dean Rusk!
So what've we got today?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
I don't like what's happening.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Who the fuck is he?
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
I'll sleep around a little.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
What did he say?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
1868...
Who did?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
That's a big comfort to me.
How so?
Yeah, most likely.
The what?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
What are you talking about?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Make what?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
And now I want you.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
No.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What is?
What?  What is it?
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
I've got it -- hold on!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Did what?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
How was it?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Come on, we're next.
Time to go.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
ON THE NOSE?
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
It was bad.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
No bother.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Or you can quit.
Not something they tell dependents.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
What happened to number five?
But maybe you can change all that.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
I'll go encode your room key.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
I am Quaid.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Hetero.
Amazing.  Where are we?
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Where is he?
Level 2.  Galleria.
He's not at ground level.
Would you please repeat the destination?
Quit while you're ahead.
Lori...
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Implanted.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Nice to meet you.
No options.
What's he talking about?
Blondes.
Hauser left me a note.
I used to model for 'em, why?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
What the hell is that, anyway?
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Why?
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
You go north, I'll go south.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
We playing cards tonight?
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
And I appreciate it.
Yeah, geography.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I brought it... to the coroner.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
It most certainly is.
I have to talk to your brother.
-- a speed manufacturer --
Ten years is a long time.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Let's get a cab.
...For ten years, now.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
That's right.
Figures.
Afraid of what?
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Oh come on, Cecil.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Shu Kai Kim.
This and that.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Albert.
Tell me some other things about her.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Don't get funny with me again.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Shorthand. Really?
Oh, the uncle is missing.
I see. He does talk loud.
That's what I heard.
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Faulty wiring.
The usual, 9:15.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Maybe.
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
WE got it back, that's all.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
We're late to get to your mother.
Dad?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Come back as soon as you can.
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Four cases in three years...
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What does it mean?
Yes.
Just now...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I...
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
What book is that?
How old are you?
I did.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Objection!
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
That's what I'd planned to...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Exception!
Yes. It was, actually.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
I... do you want me to leave?
What are you going to do?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's locked.
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
The broad has disappeared...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
Dr. Towler...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
They've all stopped at the same time.
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Where are we?
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
What is that gizmo?!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
The nightmares.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
What?
Yes, but...
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
No, you don't.
Heather?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
No.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Someone's coming.
And...what's the man doing?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Really?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
We were idealists.
What are they doing?
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You're not a moron.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
I gotta go.
Jesus.
How do you know?  They might.
What's on your mind?
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
And, of course, we are.
I can take care of myself.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Me, too.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
What do you think?
No.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I can't be sure.
They are much more than that, sir.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Y'all take American Express?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Nice of you to drop by.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
What is it, Johnnie?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Why, honey?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Hell, peanut...
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
What's that?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Where?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
You upset with me?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
What's that?
Oh God, Sailor.
You think she's gonna make it?
You sick?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Uh-huh?
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
In the head.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
You got nice tits.
No...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
He's fine. He's narrating.
It's the Chancellor.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Shut up, James.
Find the jacket.
...we find the jacket.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
How are you -- is it Joe?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Her dog, yes.
Better luck next time.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Goodbye, Grady.
Yea?
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
It's colder in there.
That's really it.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Afraid so.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Outside Scranton.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Kinship.
Maybe she didn't come here.
What?
So, why did you take me up there?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
You're lying.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Get out of here.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
Thanks for that. He all right?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
That strikes me as odd.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
But where? I need the street.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Professor Tripp.
You go first.
I'm sure.
Is the thing -- is it over?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I heard.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Who's he barking at now?
Oh?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Who's that guy?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
The perpetrator.
George Sanders?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I doubt it, darling.
Beautiful. How's business?
Hey, is that a school?
Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Is it because of Anna?
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
What party?
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Nothing.
Birds.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
Try.
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I think you do.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Little Red Riding Hood.
No.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Are you taking your medication?
But you are taking it?
People have the right to know.
What?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
How do you know?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Do you think you're crazy?
How do they know?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What about bears?
Maybe later.
So, what did you do?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
All three -- in chronological order.
Not ever?
What?
We should live together.
It's a bad idea.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I say we call it quits.
Thank you.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
If you say so.  It could be anything.
We've only got one suit.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Did you find Wilhite?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
That's Perry.
Got it. Over.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
How many are there?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
When do you have to go back?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Which one shall I wear?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes.
Does it please you to say such things?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
I love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Looks like the weather is changing.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Giulia...
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
They didn't seem too good.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Why?
Because...
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It's not that... it's not that...
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Yes.
Well, who in particular?
I love you.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
Often?
I went to my room.
Anything?
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
No.
Why not?  Mmm?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
She watches... she listens.
That you're a mistake?
How does she know that?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
I can't tell you that.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
My bed.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you feel?
Which one?
Of what?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
I hate him...
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
What did you do?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Larry...
Larry...
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You have proof?
No, no, no...
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
She has it now.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
All right, what do you need.
What is it?
Because I didn't know... 
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
Would you like one?  Huh?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Saint Peter?
Right...
Do you think they ever existed?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For the Church?
The father!
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
This is insane.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Is it because she's a nun?
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
She can't remember.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Eh?
They are?
Nine.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
How about Ding Dong?
I'm a deserter, too.
Leave them drums alone.
Are you going in?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Well ... come on.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Well, what happened?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
What's that mean?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're only right.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Lip reading.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
Come on let's get this coffee.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
I hope he fell off.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
None for me, then?
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Oh... God... am I cold...
Is that you, Roby?
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Where's Irth?
Any rotation?
You want to try?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hello, Faust!
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
You like this shit?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
What happened to the lights?
Dead!
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's really on there tight.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Yes?
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
Should we go outside and bring him in?
What?  What was that?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
What's happening up here?
Recognizable!  In that?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Blow the ship up?
What'd he say?
What is it?
No, thank God... just missed him.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
They're on the next level up.
Where are we?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Anything else?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Would somebody fill me in?
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Where did the parasites come from?
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kill me...
I'll get you out of there.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Is it dead?
Yeah, it's fine.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
What's going on?
It's too late!
Has anybody talked to them?
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Hey, Guttierez?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Hold it, hold it...
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
They've changed their heading again.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
So, what do you think?
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
You should hit the sack, too.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I can't believe my ears...
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Let's go sit by the piano.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Of course I knew.
Macbeth.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Huh?
Happy birthday, darling...
How is Eve? Okay?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
- guilty.
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Nothing, really...
What a body, what a voice.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
You know what I'm going to be?
A cowboy.
With the paper to prove it.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why you have to go out there.
So few come back...
Also Addison deWitt.
Don't run away, Bill.
I'm for it.
- and for you.
What did you expect - live sables?
Buy some.
Of course!
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
An answer.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How did you get in here?
What report? To whom?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Of course.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
Oh, but there is-
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I'm not crying.
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
There are other plays...
Did you see it here in New York?
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
They're your fans, your audience-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Roughly ten minutes.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Would you, really? How sweet-
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
I never said it was!
But that was the fourth straight time.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
I didn't hear you.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--mine's better--
Carl?
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
July of '71.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
--I haven't said anything--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Jesus--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Chapin did contact you then?
--so?
What's a real denial?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Hey... very tense.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
I will not talk about the other two.
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
Look, I told you inside--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
What?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
How grand?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Security consultant.
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
Are you sure?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
You can't believe that.
Who's Colson, Harry?
So?
Could develop.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Just go!
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
What's your middle name?
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
You don't like it?
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You're missing the game for us?!
What's that?
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
That's not why we're going out.
I think I've had one.
No comment.
Give it to me!  Yes!
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Ow, what the hell?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Hey, where's Finch?
Holy shit.
Jim?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Kevin, this is serious!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Qualify for what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Really?
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Ha-ha!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
What?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
What about your glasses?
I know. He told me.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Well, they are French.
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Shit. I feel sick.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
How to read.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
You must enjoy causing me pain!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
No! Well, yes, but
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Don't let me go!
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
What?
I'm getting a chest cold..
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
Perhaps you could convince her?
This guy's on television.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Tsch.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Stop it, Alvy!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, no, I have a car.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Oh - you're an actress.
Yeah.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, I got time.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, sorry.
Neat, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, thank you.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
it's my first time.
Hey, listen, listen.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
Yeah?
Here, you want some?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
M'hm.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Yeah.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
You don't want me to live with you?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
David? You call your teacher David?
M'hm.
M'hm.
Sinatra?
and I keep, you know, it's-
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
It's for my complexion.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Christ!
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Here you are. There's people out there.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
My head is throbbing.
Bad?
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Yeah, watch the road!
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
You all right?
How about a ginger ale?
V.P.L.?
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Oh.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Oh. What about?
Yeah.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Hey-
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's going.  It's going.
She's got great tits.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
What what's about?
To dander.  Otis.
Didn't I say?
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Let's get the kids.
And you're not the wife.
Sally?
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
There's a test, you know.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
You only made half your quote this year.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
You want me to uninvite her?
Dolphins.  Great.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Don't.
Don't do this.
I'll be with you.
That's under lock and key.
He's my favorite.
What's a sign for that?
Yes, she is.
Yes I did.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
What?
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Scout's honor.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
What am I, five?
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
You're not serious.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Sally?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Like your business managers?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Thanks.
Thank you, Panes.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Divinely?
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Out here I'm just what?
Hlllllllp!
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Z!  what are you doing?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
ARREST HIM!
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Yeah, I know.
My mother.
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
That makes me feel just terrible.
You mean tonight?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
Marry Christmas.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I just want to go brush my teeth --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Who?
When are you coming home?
As soon as I can walk.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
A cemetery?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I just want some fresh air.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
For me?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you supposed to?
What are you doing with that?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
I see you bought some napkins.
Fine. How's your eye?
Last night?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
That's right, Baxter.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
I got kicked in the head, too.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Baxter?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
You?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Me?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Who is Mickey?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Let me take that.
I missed you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
We talked about a lot of things.
Are you sure that's what you want?
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
The nerve.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Well --
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
One for all -- all for one --
Two whole drums --
We've been attacked.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Yeah.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
We do.
Yes, sir --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
How much is left?
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
... he's an amazing officer.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Smoke !
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Who knows? Right.
Would he remember you ?
Touchy.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
What, sir?
Boss left.
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
What'd you do for supplies?
I met him.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Music?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Why did you come to ... my province.
I can handle it.
What Truth?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
And you admired him?
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
What?
What's that?
Nah.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
215  CONTINUED:
Avalanche season is coming.
165  CONTINUED:  
26   CONTINUED:
Oh.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
That's not what I meant.
I'll tell you everything later.
You're hurt.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Told you I'm fine!
Shut up!
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Sure.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old for this shit.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Get the fuck out of here.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Why did yo do this for me?
No... no thank you notes.
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
You wanna dance?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Fries.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Never.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I'll take you... why not?
How you doing?
What do you want, Melvin?
Were you asleep?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Was this supposed to be your room?
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
But what about...
What are you trying to do to me?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You changed the room around...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
No touch. No touch. No touch.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Good evening.
What?
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What?
No, I didn't.
Where are all your queer party friends?
I carry bacon in my pocket.
I brought you Chinese soup.
What?
What?  You think I'm running you up?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
That's right.
What?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
An assassin?
Yes.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
What do you want to know?
Had?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Yes.
Do you have a passport?
Good.
Hey, where are you?
No.
Yes.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Really?
Okay.  Then what?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
I don't believe that.
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
Did you --
Is this becoming complicated?
Were you attracted to me right away?
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Electra --
Everyone regrets something.
I think I've heard of you.
Go ahead.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
How would you like the funds?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Yep, except a name for this place.
No....The Asylum!
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Nope.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
He got that one right.
What happened?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Yeah, no problem.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
It's that one isn't it.
Yes.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Really?
Turned Czech huh?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
It's not so much.
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will this thing take long?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
No, just a coffee.
Really!
How do I know this isn't a trap?
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
What for?
It's more than what you're worth.
Why are there still such headlines?
What are you an idiot!
All the more reason to eliminate him.
With you.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
You don't know me.
I know you don't want help.
So what else is on this list?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
No problem --
I'll get something for us to drink --
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't know what you want --
She great or what?
What?
It's only 7:30.
We're doing something -- ?
You're acting like a crazy person.
You're sometimes not sure?
What's wr--?
Come on.
Are you trying to seduce me?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
From citizen high to citizen low.
Jamie --
It was a play.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
This week.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Yes.
When do I get time for me?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
What's N.R.C.?
Fine.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Maybe if I used my left....
Who, me?
March 11th.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
What?!
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
That's all taken care of.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
There's no way of knowing.
Perfect...
You didn't?
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What did you do to your hair?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Oh yeah?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I mean it.
What'd you come out here for?
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
What for?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
It's okay.
That's my father. I got to run.
Can I be honest?
Well, stop the world.
Why not?
I can look and see.
You said that once already... Too late now.
How you doing?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Think I got 'em?
I don't want a steak.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Just thinking.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Raise your hand...where?
He offered you money?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Oh, my.
It's too dangerous.
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Please, Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
To do what?
...That's fine.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
...Got a sweetheart?
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
Hi, Charlie.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
...Can I come in?
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
What do you think happened?
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Those your only bags?
Is this multiple choice?
Anyway.
He teach you to do it?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Lipnik, I 
When did you start drinking again?
There's no smoking in this building.
So -- how are things?
How's not smoking?
I need a cigarette.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
Were you with him last night?
Did you go home with him?
Yes, you do.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Sure.
You know all about me.
Am I... disturbing you?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
You can make a mistake.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
What if I call you Nicky?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Why does he do it?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
I don't know.
What did he say?
What are you researching?
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
How's that?
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I hope I helped you out.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
What you doin', son?
What's goin' down, son?
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Where the hell you goin'?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
You sure?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
What about the shit they write?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
What?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Who said that?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Would you like to see the wine list?
Blue? Where?
SAMO.
You're shattering all my myths.
Good. What do you have?
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
... What's the matter?
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
You mean babies with you?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Have a Mac.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
I just don't think you're being fair.
I will relay the message.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
We've met.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Y'mean frame him?
Silent night, violent night...
Wonder if it's worth my time.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Alfred, are you...?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
No beauty...
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
No!?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Dick, don't push me right now.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Why, indeed?
...Afraid.
What do maniacs always want?
Mystery.
What now sir?
Up here, Al.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Slanta.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Wacko? That a technical term?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
That's usually my line.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
And now....
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
...Not the bat?
What are you talking about?
Okay. I'm outta here.
Edward...
...You gonna kill me?
A hit.
Yes?
What are you talking about?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
What now?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Allie, he's not.
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
There aren't hotels?
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Two dollars please.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Welsh.
Doctor Jacobson?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Interesting suit.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Ow! These chips suck.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Well where is she?!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Dill-wad...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
I see it. I don't get it.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
You scored with two chicks?!
No, Jane.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Two hours.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
What's she doing here?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
They make gypsies look good.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
What about this Beetle guy?
I feel really stupid.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Little black party dresses?
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We tried.
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
Just one daughter.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
I don't know what that signal means.
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Just don't tell Lydia.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Viridian?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Is there much more of this torture?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
An attorney?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
He does, does he?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
No more, Robert... No more needles...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Yes, sir.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
No. I'm a gardener.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
How is Ben feeling?
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
I see.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I am very hungry.
Bravo!
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Yes, Ben - he is.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Some pictures...?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Please, sir.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
I see.
... I see.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I live here.
Have you served in the Army?
Good morning, Mr. President.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
No headaches?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... How are the kids getting along?
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Tell your friends.
Morning.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Which one is Elijah again?
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
How was it?
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
You were him last night, weren't you?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I know. I'm sorry...
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Who told you?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Just.
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Hi.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Tickets to Malkovich?
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Hello, Don.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Two hundred dollars, please.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Yes, my dear?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Do we get to wear a crown?
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
We have to meet.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
No.
How'd you get this number?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I'd love to see your work.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Captain Mertin?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
I likes yellow.
Was a time I knew what was.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
Baby, don't be like that.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
I don't. I have my own.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
True.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
It's her, ain't it?
Her who?
Aw, no, Ella.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Never found out.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Yeah. Look bad?
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Hey!!
Yeah?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Can we just rent it from you?
Yeah.
Sheesh.
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
What--
It's already posted.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
No--
I've had a--
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Heh-heh--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Ahh, not so good, man.
I like your style, Dude.
Howdy do, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Yeah man.
He fixes the cable?
Now I got--
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
So Dieter has the money?
What happened to your house?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh.
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
The fucking point is--
The what?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
...Huh?
Huh?
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Walter!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Whose toe was it, Walter?
What about the toe?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
And the fucking money!
What's your point, Dude?
Huh?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
Yeah, and you were--
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Yeah.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Wha.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Who is this?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
WHAT?!
I'm not--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Thank you.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
How do you feel?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Getting your attention, Paco.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Tell me something, Skid --
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Going on twenty years now.
What about you?  You're not coming?
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Get in. Youre leaving.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Who is LaMagra?
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Graffiti --
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
Like what?
Some kind of archive --
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
It won't work on you.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
What?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
How do you like that? Right on time.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
So what do you use, then? A stake?
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Whistler!
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What do you mean?
What, are you alright?
--Christ almighty--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Baby names?
I think we get the gist.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Nothing. I dunno--
No.
What'd you dream?
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
Absolutely.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
How'd you know they were--
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
What movies?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
We should be so lucky.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
English.
Where's Domini?
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
What the fuck--??
--I saw what I saw.
Be it still alive, James?
That's a "j."
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
403 41st Street, kids: home.
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
What?
He'll never know.
Sure. I'm sorry.
Get some more beer.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Heather.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Why?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Your mother's pastor.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
Hello?
Ray--
...Where is everything?
What do you want to know?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Thanks.
...So what're you doing tonight?
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
...You know that car?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...What kind of fish?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Red Label.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
...Why?
Where was I?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
To your health, Frank.
Jeffrey?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Where are we going, Frank?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
No.
Falling.
Yes.
Do you love me?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Oh yeah?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Maybe so.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
What happened to him?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
So. what's next?
You really want to do this, don't you?
What's the plan.
Are you sure?
Okay. thanks.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
You were late.
Shoot.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
You like mysteries that much?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Everything okay?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
What is it?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Why are you speaking?
Excuse me?
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
Yeah.  She told me.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Good night.
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
What's the matter, George?
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
There's no room.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Today.
Surprised to see me?
Mexico.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Family.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
You're not going to trial?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Why are you smiling?
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Well, here I am.  See?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
For instance, something like this?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Second district ...
What ... What must I decide?
Can you read?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What'd he die of?
Yes.
What did they argue about?
No -- never.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
A little after eleven.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
What happened next?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
Why does she come to you?
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Yes.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What happened?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
No.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
A.M -- or P.M.?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Do you think I did it?
Frank!
How?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
What?
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Rebecca -- take these off.
You killed him -- didn't you?
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Why?
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
What's she like?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Is that alright, Frank?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I'm not.
It's more involved than that.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Bar across the street.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Not yet. You want to go?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Heat is heat.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
After the divorce.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Help cook?
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You want to go back in?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I'll pick you up.
Oh.
How about if I set the table?
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
You're somewhere else, where?
Uh-huh. And?
Yes, thanks.
I... What do you want?
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
WHY?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Want anything special for dinner?
Betty.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
I said, no thanks.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
Since we was just grasshoppers...
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
I can't.  Not yet.
Where is it?
What are we doing down here?
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Did you do it?
That's the past.  It's dead.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
We just thought...
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
You shouldn't have hit me.
Admit what?
The same way you did before.
Where is it?
We know how this was done, eh?
No, Gino!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
There's no time.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Stupid cunt!
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Where is it?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
How did you meet him?
Five years is a long time.
I don't understand - ?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
You said he washed the money?
Yeah.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
He does it right in front of him.
An accident.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
He'll have to run.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I'm still here.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
What is Treadstone?
I think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
I don't know.
Look, maybe I should just...

Paris?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Did you?
So what's in Paris?
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
-- you could put it together --
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Thanks for the ride.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
Oh, Jesus...
-- forget it --

Shit, we didn't sign in.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
You telephone, sir.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
What? How do you know my name?
Er ... Thanks ...
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Enough though, eh?
So how ...?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Why?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Do you know what you're doing.
Jack?... Jack?
You stupid bastard!
Are you alright?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
Well, no system is.
Look at that - right on time.
Every day?
What?
You're joking.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Get away!
We? Don't blame me!
"And your children all gone."
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Yes.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't do anything silly.
Tuttle?
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
He is dead.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
What?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
How long will she he away?
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Uh ...
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Hello ... hello ...
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
what? ... Oh ... 
For God's sake, what's happened?
Ha!!
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Mary said you might be coming.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
No.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
He's very very sick.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Did you see my father?
He's better, isn't he?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He's better.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Three legs.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
No.
Where's Burke?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Mr. Oh.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
What?
I'm not hungry.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Shut up a second...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Yes.
Yes.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Of course.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Do you feel good about it?
What?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
I understand.  I'll go with you.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
What is she shooting?
Almost immediately.
Jane?
But thanks.
Play back the last line...
No stop where he's all besieged.
They're not really going to call security are they?
Anchor?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Why so glum?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Why, you need me for the story?
So what did you think?
It's incredible who's here.
What happened?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Then you should stay here.
Go ahead -- what?
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Don't you work here?
I didn't finish talking to you!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
I'm almost ready -
Whaddya mean?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Don't ask.
Why not?
I know.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I know, man.
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
You didn't mean to what?
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Well, w-what did you do?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Huh?!!!
Telling you what?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Why not?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Nice game.
Don't grab me, okay?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
He doesn't look fifty.
Do you know what time it is?
What's Bobby gonna say?
You okay?
Come on, what was it?
I do?  I guess I do.
You're even weaker than the others.
Hi.
How are you doing?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Dress, huh?  What for?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Are you okay?
Where?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
I was a slave.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Where's the other one?
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Who we gonna beat?
I had to test you.
It was necessary.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
You are such a wet.
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
There isn't time.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Football is my life.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
I haven't seen him tonight.
My parents have money...
I can't!
Got that.
Buffy?
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Switch nostrils?
Death is like spring training?
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
You don't have to...
Well I guess this is it.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
I'm Crash Davis.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Crash...I want you.
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
What happened?
What?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Who's he play for?
We gonna fuck or what?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
But he ain't seen my heat--
How?
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
I gotta go now, Dad.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We'll pray anyway.
He walked eighteen?!
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Who ain't?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
Excuse me.
Oh, good.
She's not here, Sam.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
They payin'?
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
Then he called me a faggot.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
All right, fine.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
My wife?
Okay?
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
I just told you. She called me.
She was afraid to call you.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
Hello.
No, I'm not okay.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Hello.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
What can I do?
Well, sir, I was just...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
We can't get rid of him?
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Who's this?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Okay, thank you for asking.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Okay.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Okay.
Pretty serious.
...twenty-five thousand?
With what?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
I bought him a watch too.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
You're not takin' Amy.
You threw it away?
With Jennifer.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
You fuckin' whore!
You want your jewelry?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Just wait there for me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Not gonna let me in?
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
Well...
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
I really think you're -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Can't do it with both hands?
Look what they did to my hand, man!
I don't want to go to Europe.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Can I go in?
Pitch-black?! It -
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Here we go!
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie!
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
It's in all the papers.
Of course, Remo.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
He's good. He's fine.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Mm.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Sure.
You're so nice. 
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Hm.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yes, you did.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Get lost?
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
I know. I know.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry.
That's enough.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
The crowd bought it.
In women?
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Selina, are you okay?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
God, can you hear me!
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
What's the catch?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
What?
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Are you guys all right?
You missed.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Nels?
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Lady, try making some sense.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
You won't disconnect.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Pictures.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I can hear you again, clearly.
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Can you walk?
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
You're going to let them get away with this?
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
259-7881.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
You won't live to see it.
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Got a phone in that van?
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Hold on.
I already called for an ambulance.
Undercover.
I thought so.
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why doesn't she?
Yeah?
Did I?
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Sure, Dave --
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
No.
Jimmy.
What was that all about?
You know.
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
What's that about?
Like what?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Tell me about him.
Shouldn't I go?
No --
Yes...
But you can t stay, you know that?
What is this?
No...
What you doing here?
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
Don't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
She from Scotland too?
Do you like me even a little bit?
Anything.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
So tell me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You heard what I said, Dil?
In a manner of speaking.
I suppose I tried.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Yes.
Yes. Now.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Fergus!
Need to go across the water.
Can't.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Och, you do, Fergie.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
You were made for this.
Was I?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
I take pride in my work.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Thanks.
Yes.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Definitely unusual.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Thank God for that.
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
How is it a farce?
Thank you, handsome.
No. It's the truth.
No?
Absolutely not.
Shut up, would you?
I don't know her.
Go to sleep now.
When I was a child...
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Not here.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Adam --
Yes, you told me.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Reggie -- listen to me --
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
So that was it.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Oh, I see.
Oh.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
That's the spirit.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
No.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Yes.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Why you lied to me.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Said what?
Okay.
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Maybe.
What? Assassinate somebody?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Why don't you shut up!
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
I don't believe it.
How much is it worth?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
And if it is?
But his mother --
You loved him?
He didn't have one.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
I don't understand.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Quitter.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Now you're angry.
Shakespeare never said that.
Doing what?
What's going on?
Who said?
How do you shave in there?
What'd he say?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Don't put yourself out.
He knows everything.
I've never seen him before.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I want you to head right home after school.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
You are upset.
Who's?
But I shouldn't shut it down?
You aren't going to the party?
Really?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Does she fuck?
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
What party?
Stag?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Lisa Sherman?
What?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
What?
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Why don't I--?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.

No.
Yeah, borrowed!
You're nuts, goin' back there!
...work!  It's not even load-...
...-ed.

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...wanna give it a try!
...you crazy bastard.
 I made it.

Ho, ho...


 Okay.  Okay. 

What?
No!


See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
You know what I'm sayin'?
...or nephew or some good old boy...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
We got two paddles.
I mean, if that gun was...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...split.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...


Okay. 


Go, go, go! 
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-natic.
...to him. 
Here...
 What's it say? 

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.

That was quick.
We're worried...
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
You-You can't let him...
...-lem too?
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...

Whoo-hoo! 
They were all wearing hardware.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
And I changed the schedule.
...I wish they would've let me say something...
You look fit...healthy...
Mm-hm.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
So far, ye-yes.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.

Radio the bikes.

Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Get your links set up!
Right.  Tim Mason.
Not tonight...
Yeah?
I want you to look at one another...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?

Where's Elvis?!

Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?

...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Geneva just pulled the plug.
...now!
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
My secret?
...is a perfect hunter.
...the master of his realm.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
...tunnel!
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
Let me see your...

 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
What the hell was that?
I'll lead 'em out.
All right, go.

Negative.  Negative.
If that's what it says.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Do you know him?
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Why is that funny?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Off the alley.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
No.
I don't.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
That's it?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A complete surprise?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Not that Mulwray?
Would you like something to drink?
What?
No. I went riding rather early.
I'll stop by.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
For very long?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Another satisfied client?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No, I think I'd remember.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
I gave everybody the night off.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
I know.
You saw my fa... father? When?
What did he say?  What did he say?
Yes.
Where's the girl?
I want to see her.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
No...
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
I said I want the truth.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Back to Mexico.
I'll take care of it.
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
Walsh here?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
I'm sorry. We don't.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
I'm sorry, I --
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
Yes...
What about the water?
Yeah.
Gittes?... Gittes?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Since lunch.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She ran away?
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
Hi, Elena!
I don't care. I'll wait.
For what?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
I'm sure that's it. 
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
Hello, Brad -
Almost two to one -
Emily!
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Oh!!
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Charlie, please don't -
You're no Venus de Milo.
Oh!
A chicken?
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I didn't say.
I mean in New York.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Can't say, sir.
Poor Mr. Carter!
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
What do you mean by that?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Why, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
I know you will.
What check?
Mr. Leland, you were -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Was he in love?
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
She's plastered, isn't she?
Are you sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You're shittin' me.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
She said not to come home until graduation.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
Can I watch?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
You saw it?
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Look how full of yourself you are.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
What about Sing?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I'm serious.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Well he asked me for it!
Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
What do you two fight about?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Great story, isn't it?
Your mother.
What about Veronica?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Empire.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
The milkmaids.
Why not?
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Exactly. They drank it all.
Jesus.
I can't close the store.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
You were saying?
An embarrassing way to die.
Shut the hell up.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
Reach what?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Let me borrow your car.
What?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Holy shit. That girl?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
Around three or something.
Thirty-seven.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
What responsibility?
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
How's your eye?
You still didn't have to choke me.
It's not like I'm miles away.
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Are there any balls down there?!
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Lasagne.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Ooh! Can we?!
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
How many what?
Including you?
Three including you.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Why do you call him that?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Let it go...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I'm going to class.
Hey! Where are you going?!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
You said you were here all day?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way!
Is he staying here?
No way!
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
Really?
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
No, I wasn't.
I beg your pardon!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
And... he told you all of this?
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
A monkey?
Tucker?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
We'll never know, will we?
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
She's tough.
Two...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Call me sentimental.
This rope is sixty years old!
Don't let me fall!
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
I burned it.
Tucker and Walker.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
What the hell are you doing--
This way.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Fine, sir, fine.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
I did, sir.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Well, how are you then?
Well - I'm back.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Yes sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
How're you feeling this morning?
Fine... fine.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Something like that.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Are you referring to the background score?
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Oh.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir, 655321, sir.
The ride is free.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
It's no big deal.
Big case?
In my office?
Jesus...
Remember what you played?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Something going on?
...if they're wrong?!
What's your name?
I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
He'll keep calling.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Hello?
It's home.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You on some kind of work plan?
You - you killed him?
The trunk?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
How?
I never learned jazz.
What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Show up for <u>what?</u>
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I'm sorry.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
She must be some girl.
Look, I'm sorry --
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
I think you're different.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Them who?
Nothing is easy.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Was that who I thought it was?
Never, but I've been practicing.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
That was him.
He's why you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Geronimo is down.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
I'm a very patient man.
What's that?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
<u>Why you</u>?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Working.
Jonas?
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
That you come with me.
There's no plug to pull.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
So?
I disagree.
You know why I'm here.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
What would you have me say, David?
What...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
What?
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
But what do I say?
You're not real.  None of this is.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Can you show me?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So.  What happens now?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
That isn't the way it works.
You live here.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
And in return?
It's so... small.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Peter Valerian.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
The V.L.A.?
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
Ellie.
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Champagne please.
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Yes.  Very much.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Ellie, what is it?
What are you so afraid of?
Hi.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
But --
Recommendations?
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
What are you doin' here?
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Borrowin'.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Where'd the road go?
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
What's the writing say?
Man Oh Man.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
You get me out first.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Who was the man in the basement?
You know where.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Is he out?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
How do you know that?
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Tell me what to do!
Is there a phone booth there?
Open the door.  Please.
Just get out of your vehicle...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Classy madonna.
What's wrong with him?
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
What about her arms?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
What's Abba?
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
What the hell you need her for?
I just got here myself, Susan.
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
Detective Niccoletti?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
And her husband? What was he?
What!? They brought the car here?
One of your suitors?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I want to see my mother immediately.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
What?
Really?
Fuck me.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Yes.
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
There's a spider in my room.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Don't be ridiculous.
Just checking.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
It's TV heaven.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Always the drugs.
I guess we need to talk.
I sure know what that feels like.
Well then why'd it happen?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Can I put these here for tonight?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Yes, I suppose so.
Especially now.
No, no.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Office work?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
You killed her!
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Who?
It's me...
No.
What?
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Okay.   How much?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
I assume you want something?
I only have your word for that.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Does it really matter what I say?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Okay, we're square now, right?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Good song though.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
I was told to take what we have and go.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
What the hell is he talking about?
No.   How much?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Me?
You guys used to work together?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
The hell it is.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
How?
No shit?
Yeah, I dig him.
How are we going to do that?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
You ask a lot of questions.
Why?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Who are you?
Where's your master?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Shut up!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Put them down.
This spells trouble.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
You're not married, are you?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Kneel!
Never!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Don't send me back!
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Good.  And how are you?
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Have you questioned him yet?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
How 'bout the morgue?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
In a better place.  I hope.
I don't know you.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
That's ancient history.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Yes.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
I'll be fine.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
From who?
You promise not to say anything?
Why not?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
The Fountainhead.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
I sincerely doubt it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
You implied it.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Yes it does.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Would you like a tour?
But you knew this was important to me.
Ben Schwarz.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Where did you say she's from?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
I'm in the bath, mom.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Eww. No. That's gross.
That was cool.
Okay.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
If that's what you call it.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Just a kiss, right?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Is it me?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Yummy.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
And you think she bought it?
Who is this?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
I see your point... though why should I care?
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Any day now.
Who are you calling?
You amaze me.
That her?
Morning.
With who?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I think you have your answer.
You're too kind.
You will be discreet about this?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Nope.
Hey Ronald.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Mommy --
On the back street  a green house
Do you know the people?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Where'd you get this, darling?
She was very pretty.
It's early yet.
I think I should.  3000W?
I'm never unfair.
It's your play.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Where did you mail them?
Amy, not that old tree!
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
I didn't forget.
What do you want. Amy?
They ran away.
Why didn't you run after them?
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
Oh, thank you, Amy.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
But she's dead!
A lady threw it to me.
But she's such a nice lady.
But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
The Headless Horseman --
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
Let the child stay.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
Does she have PMS?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Where?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
No. I don't think so.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
Are those Mark's?
Give him the tampon test.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Did you get rid of Mark?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Peter keeps asking me out.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
About Mark? Carlton?
Hello?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Look what you did!
This really isn't a good time.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Like what?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Everything okay?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Is that how you feel?
Your breasts feel larger.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
We can get a warrant if you like.
It's for you. Frida.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
What are you talking about?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
How will we interrogate them?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
What is this place?
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
Lost something?
Sorry, sir.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
Good.
It seems fine.
Yes.
Where does it lead?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
What does she say?  The woman.
What are you hiding?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
How much do you usually get paid?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
... Alright.
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I'm... not... nobody...
Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
... What?
A condition...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Nobody's got clean kids.
What I told him to?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
So you want to go swimming?
This is undeclared income.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Oh my God...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
At a press conference.
Alan...
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Oh... Thanks.
I was waiting for that jack.
Who?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Anybody would have done it.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
They asked me to help.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I know.
It was okay?
What?
They're crucifying you out there.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Please....shoot me.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Tonight?
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Datura.
What?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
It's because of me.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
How was dinner?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Yeah.
What is the point?
What do you mean you don't know?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Doing fine, sir.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.
Are you going with Chet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
A yawp?
AHHHHHH!
A crazy madman.
Don't stop!
Okay.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Isn't there an easier way?
She won't even see me, Pitts.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
What?
A play, dummy.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
It's not going to help us!
Now look what you did!
I saved your life is what I did!
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
What are you people talking about?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
You don't have to be so touchy.
Right... You have a boat.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
So?
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Yeah.
We're all going.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Damn right!
They did too!
I know, but...
I do!!!
She does not!
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
No, I --
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Biederman, yes.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Sure.
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
You're going hunting?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I want to go home, Merle.
You do?
Fucking A.
Pow?
What are you, hoping?
I thought you might be praying.
Forget Sal.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
What's that noise?
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
No.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Technothugs?
What did you say?
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
Remember my promise.
We have to talk.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
She's pretty.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
You're not pregnant, are you?
...Have you been drinking?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You be careful.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Hi.
You could always take it off.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You're lying.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Anybody can see that.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No! No! I won't.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Loan shark -- hey?
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Sure am.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
About what?
You know darn well it is.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Coming along, Jabez?
Yes.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
I'll get the doctor.
Mary --
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Let him try it.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Hullooo!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I can't be honest with them.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
The code key, please...?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
You...you're an American?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
I'm going to count to three...
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How long?
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Holly Gennero?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Bullshit.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
So whatsa deal?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Jesus, you're the man!
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Don't call yourself fat.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Ooohh....
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah.
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
You try calling the police?
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
You alone, or you got confederates?
How many you got in there?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
He wanted to kill me!
They were ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Hey... let him out!
Howard, give him the keys...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
Yeah.
What now, Sonny?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
You were terrific, too!
No, not until after they killed him.
You shouldn't start now.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Goddamn women...
What?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
We won't have to.

Sal?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
I forgot she's in here.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
We can't stay here.
No!
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
And if you can't deliver them?
Morning.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Hello?
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Yep.
I don't know.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
No. Please enlighten me.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Must you use that awful word?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Cool it, Choco.
What did he say about the arm?
Do you know where Danang is?
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Mookie.
What?
You the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
What makes Sammy run?
How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Yo, I'm gone.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
He's just being nice.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Jade, you're late.
This might take some time.
And move to Long Island...
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
It's dug.
ML?
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
I work too, but I still make time.
Tina, you're sweating.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
You deaf or what?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
That's what you think?
That's what I think.
I love you, my brother.
How do you know this?
I know.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Cool.
No no no no no.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Will not.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
You're it.
Can he do that?
How do you know it's for us?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Some what?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I don't think so.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
No one knows?
A blimp.
Hey, it's Jessica.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
But my mom gave me the map.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
That's the downside. There is none.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
God, I've missed you.
Wow, you are smart.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Everything?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
What does Leto say, Piter?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Basically...
I'm sorry Gurney.
Is this what you seek?
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
My Lord?
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
You know the ancient tongues?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Yes...
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Uh, beg to differ.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
Why were you buying a coffin?
Don't you bave a car?
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Bela, are you ready?
So why didn't you do it?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
What happened?!
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Ed, it was only one review.
Better than not getting a job?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
How long have you been doing this?
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Raising money is tough.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Yes?
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
My eyes are killink me.
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Is there a script?
Are you a fruit?
So you're not a fruit?
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
What was that?
Those assholes.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
You know, to make the legs move --
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Isn't that the same thing?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
No.
What?
No, uh...
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
What if Shari's the dream?
Leave her be.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --
Thank you. Can I see her?
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Really? They were..
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Right, right...
So he killed himself.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
It's... okay
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
What are you doing?
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Where?
Everybody's someone.
What?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
What?
Ray --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
pierdo.
Tu
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Having a problem with your eye there?
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Larry?
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Here they are.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
So what brings you here?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Why are you doing this?
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
And how did you get in the school?
What do you want, Jim?
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
I'm not like you.
What...?
What?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
I want to know about Exley.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Of course... But how?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
What was that boyfriend's name?
That's him.  That's him.
Was it... a rat?
What happened?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
More or less.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
And?
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
How about White?
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Something good?
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Have we met before?
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
DePinto's dead.
Nothing.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Listen to me--
You've got it on tape?
When can you get it here?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
And you won't. Now move--
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
Jesus!
I called from a payphone!
I didn't use my name.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
They come after you?
That is one ugly sunrise.
Yeah.
They're here.
You're driving.
Think we let out enough air?
That wasn't so hard.
Drive.
Drive.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
What if--
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Well then who can?
Law enforcement?
Oh my God.
Very good.
<u>What's</u> your point.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
I'm not his attorney.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Just for the criminals.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
That ain't me.
You don't know who the fuck--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Rachel--
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
He didn't.
You're firing me.
Who won the fight?
It's okay to use the phone.
No.
Jerry--
Bobby--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
How can I reach you?
He got hit by a bus.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
We'd have to--
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
We believe?
You're kidding me.
So they know everything.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Federal Express?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
You felt obliged to.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Do they know them?
Now.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
What?
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
A broken car?
Safe journey.
Could I trouble you for some water?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
How are you?
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where did you find that?
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
I see.
What did you say?
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
He needn't disturb you.
Your friend?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
I'll probably marry him.
Really?  That's sudden.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Kip - come and dance with me
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
He can't even move.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Go away.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I don't think so.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
How close?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
Uh, yes.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
So what?
Well, no...but...
But Roki said--
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's entrapment.
Good morning.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
Let's do it again.
Aren't we all.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
What about the rules?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
That was a lifetime ago.
Four billion dollars.
He looks familiar.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
Where've you been?
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
What the hell is this doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
All of 'em?
So you say.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
You're a lawyer?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
All I have is hundreds.
So what made you think it was?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
So you think we got 'em scared?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Then I don't get anything either.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
No shit.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
How dare you take that away from me.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Which number do you want, George?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
What?  But you been working so hard --
You are someone.
I'm just saying --
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Keep your voice down.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Have you been logging on?
Uh-huh?
You're moving away?  When?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
He'll learn.
I can help them!
You won't.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks a blue streak.
I'm looking for someone.
Give me that!
Mine, mine.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
We?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
Probably an asteroid field ....
What is it?
Are you crazy!
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
A mining colony.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Hyperdrive.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Not really.
It's a lovely outpost.
What's going on?
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Why not me?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
What are they doing here?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Who's that?
Ooww!
Give it to me.
You told me he was dead.
Oh Cuervo...
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
I need a favor.
Dream on, blue eye.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Not you?
Plissken...?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
No way.
Where is it?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
You need help.
Snake - what is it?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
I'm looking for somebody.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I cannot--
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
So be it, to the death.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
But, I'm here.
You freed it, son?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Why didn't he kill us?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
What did the doctor say?
I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Rats?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Convulsion?
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
No I didn't know you had one.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Why, I don't understand?
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Where's Regan's father?
What's the difference?
Who's Captain Howdy?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
Okay
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Shut up!!
From the psychiatric end.
It's possible. Possible however
Are you comfortable Regan?
Sometimes.
I don't know.
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Beasley.
Two at a time?
My brother and I. One each.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
How's the birthday girl?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
What's the gig?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
I don't gotta go.
Your older brother.
Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Very realistic.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
She's a big girl.
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
April.
Yeah.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Jack, you're on television.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
You weren't there.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Spur of the moment.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
I'm sorry?
Uh... he knows it.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
You're an hour and a half late.
Ready?
That!  You can't wear that!
A seven.
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.
Maybe it's legit.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Virgins?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Peggy Lee?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
Born and bred.
Thanks.
He doesn't bite.
Frank works hard.
Is that the way it is?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Where's egghead?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
I didn't want to wake you.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Oh?
Older than me.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Fine.  You?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
You mean if I get sick?
What did he do?
And this thing can grow it?
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
So you had a nightmare.
No.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Jamie ...
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
What's on your mind?
Her assistant?
Hello?
Adelle?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Take you, for instance...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Hey, is that really necessary?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Its lovely...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Are we finally being honest?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Are you okay?
Uh...that babys crying...
Hey!  I was watching that!
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
No?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
If you want to look at it that way...
You mean this chocolate cake?
Say it, Jack...
Not it...?
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
To Paris. Paris, France.
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
You cant go!
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Not by a long shot.
Peter Lassiter...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
I want to see you again.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
We had a tough year.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
About me?  How sweet.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Not this again --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
Yes, thanks.
What?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Trip? Where to?
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
What about Dr. Michaels?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Two in a row?
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
I don't believe that.
All in all, quite a canoe...
What happened?
Uh -- what?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
I don't think so. It's nice.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Clear him off the road.
One of us pays the other for half.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Personal matters.
Any others?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Uh-huh.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Mm.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
You know what a disparity is?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Jerome Lundegaard?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
...Dad?
Twice.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
What's goin' on there?
Stan and I're okay.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Carl somethin'?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Yah?
...Geez.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah.
Well, how the heck are ya?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
So?
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
His wife?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Yah.
Still missing. We're looking.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
...So?
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
The dynamite...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Like testicular cancer?
What... ?
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Make sure.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
I don't know.
You hear that?
I'm sorry, I...
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
What do you do, Tyler?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
What list?
Well, I have to file a claim...
What?
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
What?
You're sure?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
What are we doing?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Look...
"Too young?"
Why do people think anything?
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
Yes...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
You want out?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Why... why... why... ?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You told me you'd say that, too.
His name is Robert Paulson!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Yesssss...
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What do you want me to do?
Speed up.
Carter.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
I've got to stop and help those people.
This is cheery.
Sure.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I'll remove him.
You're the fuckin' devil.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
"Next?"
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Read you.
What's she saying?
It's a guy in a cage.
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
You're gonna love it.
Why'd they want us?
Look, Co...
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
Who're you?
Can you walk?
Am I out of here?
But now it's free, right?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Really?
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
He's not a moron.
What does that mean?
Hello....congratulations.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
... What?... You don't want to commute?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
A list.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
... Do you know who I am?
They work for Him.
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Do you follow her every day?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
It's such a great song.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Happily married, probably.
Will you stand still so I can do this!
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
I advise you to let us go.
Are you all right?
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
I leave it to you.
Well, id'n that nice.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Just finish eating.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Who?
No. How much do I owe you?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
I don't make the rules.
Now don't...
Sorry.
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
It's none of your business!
Thank you.
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
Robert?
Just give me a chance, will you?
What?
No, it's okay.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
That's an old maid's tale.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Well, she was.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Nothin'.
No.  What you do today?
So you got a girl?
Of course.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Wha'?
Where you goin'?
C'mon.
You looking for somebody?
Wha'?
What she look like?
Positive.
I'm a good friend of hers.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Where you know Amanda from?
You live around here?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Hey you're really nuts.
They didn't do anything.
It was planted on me, sir.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
This one's going to be even more fun.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
That's Babar.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Right.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
No idea.
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
Gum thought Brazil.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
That's it.
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Good evening.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
I'd have been long gone.
And what was that?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Why are they after you?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
We can't talk about it here.
Why not?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Who?
So why pick me?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Shoot.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Preoccupied with what?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
What is this?
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
But I've seen the deed.
What is this....
You can't do that.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
You want I set up?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
So you're saying she moved out.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
You broke it? You know the source?
I'd say charcoal.
Gummy and two cops...
What about finding the source?
I want something I can print!
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Fletch, you want an apology?
Not really.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Jim Swarthout?
You don't know the Underhills?
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Who?
I'll do my best.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
All your friends call you Jazz.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
How'd you get this from her?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Contacts.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Hey, they blew me.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Hello?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Zuzu, wake up...
Ford, you were right!
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, go on...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
What's fine?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Hi, private eye guy!
Yeah?
I don't...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Pour moi?
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
I got no music!
Where from?
When ya go back on?
Morning.  Sometime.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Don't know what's behind it.
Damn.
Butch called.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Wish you weren't.
Okay...
I know.  He loves that thing.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Next time lets put some money on it.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Sorry 'bout that.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What?
Oh my god.
That's impossible.
How could this be happening?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What's that?
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Got it.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
What are we like in...1998?
You really wanna know?
Sull!  What the hell!
How you feeling?
My father didn't die in a fire?
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Who are you?
Hell-
What're you gonna do?
Breakfast?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Will you come with me?
A hammock?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Why did you come back here?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
See anything?
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You don't "have to."
I never said you were "nothing".
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
What it is?
Why?
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
I need to talk to you.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Legs giving you trouble?
Ed...
Okay.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
For a good reason.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was a community service.
How many times do you want to hear this?
You don't know shit!
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
That was truly excellent.
Well...how do you feel?
What murders?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
Jason's here in New York.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
He is not.
I...I can't...
I'm staying.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Hi, Sean.
But I didn't get you one...
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
You are going where?
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Guys ready to order?
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Shut up, Elliot.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight. What's tonight?
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Is it safe?
I say we go.
Where are you going?
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Does what feel comfortable?
I talked to her two days ago.
Can he get through it?
About what?
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
Do you want to get some coffee?
Why do you need a radio?
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Your father said you might be here.
How prominent?
This could be it!
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Because life is good.
This could be it!
'm not worried about this kid.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
Yes, Peter.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I hear good things about the new play.
But you're his friend.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
It is the work of untouchables.
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
No violence, please.
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
What can we do?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
No?  What's keeping you?
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
That's the last.
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
That's not the point.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Any particular reason?
Where?
Is that all?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Will you be okay?
Not bad, Jerome.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What exactly is wrong?
Who are they?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Beynon.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Fifteen minutes.
There better be a guy with the
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
You've got it all figured.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
When are you going to learn?
You can't trust anything these days.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Come on, come on.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Gonna knock down a wall?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Just fine.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Who?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Good evening.
That's nice.
Confidential, like.
Where's he living these days?
Can I go now?
Do you?
Oh, do you?
Yes.
He was here for four days.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Nice of you to come.
Yeah.
It just would. He was always the same.
Where would I find him?
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Yeah.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Are you a traveller?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What is it?
I'll call the police.
They bloody hurt me.
What about Keith?
You wouldn't.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
And that'll make me feel better?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Meaning what?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Eh? Have a drink.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yeah.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
Well, I think I had one once.
What?
They killed the goose.
It is.
All of, they got you on this "board..."
Some contest board...
Eh...?
That's right?
Who?
Yes.
Starting up.
You...
As an idea.
What did he say?
You're saying "me."
Is that what I said?
So I'm making it concrete.
You need money?  Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Can we get some coffee...?
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Clear...
It is dead.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They aren't?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Yes.
No.
Will you excuse us please?
You...
Who used to say that?
I don't know, George, why?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Go to lunch, George.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
...ah, fuck this...
Either way.  You're out.
Yes.
And fifty bucks a lead.
What happened?
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
No.  It hadn't.
Uh-huh?
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Dave...
When?
From the store.
Harriett...
You closed 'em today?
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Yes.
Oh!  For the magazine...
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
I'm sorry...?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Gimlet.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
I'm not.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What?
Fuckin' asshole.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
What is this, your farewell speech?
Yes.
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
...you want to go out today...?
...Mr. Williamson...
Do you like them?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I can help you.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What position did you occupy?
 What?  You read it in the papers?
Connie.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael...
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I don't want to stay here...
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
Ready, Frankie.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
It was hard to have him killed.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
What do you want me to do?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I've always taken care of you.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
Why?
Kay... Kay...
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Goddamn it, where were you?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
Me too, Tom?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
What was it, so I'll know.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Fifteen percent skim?
What's up?
You're right.
What the hell are you talking about?
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Senator Kane.
This committee owes an apology!
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Sleeping inside me.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
There are still things I have to do.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
You're a considerate young man.
We do favors for each other...
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
The money was sent.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Sure.  I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
You will not hurt him?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Then you're as single as I am.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
What?  Oh yes.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
What's to sketch?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Your family ate dripping?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
All right, I guess.
No.
Did you kill anyone?
So we understand each other?
What happened?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
How long were you...?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Everybody has stories to tell.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No.  The girl.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Run for what?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Do I have any other choice?
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
A very lucky thing indeed.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
You okay?
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
They gave you only four days?
You got no choice. It's over.
You have my word...
And this has what to do with me?
Not my girl anymore
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
okay ...
C'mon, man ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
No.
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
Yeah ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You okay -- ?
You hear me?
"Shadow games?"
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
A distinction worth noting ...
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
The alarms go off ...
Now... I'm in ...
No worries ...
Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
What -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Uh ... Randall -- ?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
What do you do?
What bag?
Henry.  Wake up.
Jezuz Christ!
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
You what?
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
What'll I tell Fran?
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
You want the melon?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
I hate to do dishes.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
You want a partner?
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Who's she talking to?
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
No, I had to talk him down.
You're kiddin' me.
Hi.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Come on, Will...
Morgan, Let's go.
Retainer...
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Codebreaking.
That's one aspect of what we do.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
And what do you see?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
--that?--
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
I can come back.
Will.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
Good to meet you.
Sean.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
You're here quite a bit, then.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Sean...
Where're you going?
I don't know. India maybe.
Why there?
Will, your not getting off that easy.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
When did you know she was the one?
What?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
You want to read it?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
I know.
I kind of got that impression.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
No I haven't...
You grew up around here?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Bullshit.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
I've never seen your place.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Some, a little.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Will? Are you awake?
What?
How do you know that?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Is that what you think--
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Gallon or two?
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
What'd he look like again?
Short fella. Pale face.
I didn't see nothin'.
Kinda pie y'got?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
What's it to you?
So long.
Four.
Two.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Is it fur?
They're all gone--or dead.
They never wrote you nothing?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
Thought you was in jail.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Yeah.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
I never asked you!
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you going?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
But will it--hurt the baby?
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Anybody ask anything?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sometimes they do.
Ma, you sick?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Which ones?
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
I wisht it was day.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Please don't.
Morning.
Can you pick peaches?
In the corporate offices.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Computer guy.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Yes.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Are you going to the reunion?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Watched television?
Bad television.
Are you there?
Hello...?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Will you come with me?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Is that right?
If he does our job, he's our job.
All of it?
He didn't.
Don't forget your identity.
I spoke to your father the other day.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Paul?
He sold me this bad boy.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Does Chicago count?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Son?
The point was to love each other.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
No, you didn't.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I don't care.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
You got everything you need?
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Who's going to want me now?
I should be in by two.
That bag's almost empty.
No, let me go.
You've got to stop doing that?
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Why?!
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
When are you coming home?
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Take your time.
I don't understa-
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
I'd love to go there one time...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
You don't seem to upset?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Why do you always wear that hat?
She gonna be long?
I can't...
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
What does that mean?
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
It's warmer than I thought.
What, sweetheart?
I know. Amazing.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Yeah, cool.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Cereal.
Dade?
Up all night again, huh?
Hmmm.
Revenge.
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Two days.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Phreak?
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
So?
Thank you.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
When did you find this out?
Brady!
Shit!
Get up there Rachel!
An accident?
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Because the lights are all out.
How many people in the bus?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
It's been eleven months.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
You don't believe that do you?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
That's all the windows, Dad.
Call me.
Where are you going?
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
I am. Ben Meeker.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Okay.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I don't see anything.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
You still spooked?
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I can't.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
There was no one outside.
I promise.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
PROBABLY going.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Pull up to the entrance!
Mmm?
Right.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
You're joking.
And you, you-you're going?
We're actresses.
Is this your first job?
Uh-huh.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
When did you first notice this?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, God.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Yeah.  How are you?
I'm...all right.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I thought you weren't coming.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Great idea.
I know.
You bet.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
You've been with someone!
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Come on.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Huh?
I know, I know.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Mh-hm.
Oh!
Go right over there.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
What are you talking about?
I want to experience childbirth.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
What?  You're kidding!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Really?
Uh-huh.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Thanks for a swell time.
Yeah?
Nobody ever said it.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Well, what about me?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Thanks.
Tch.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Take our literature...
They're offering... 
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Rich, comic book freaks.
I'm not.
Then you tell me, then.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
He escaped...
He don't like popcorn.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Said what?
Waal...
I said how's your baby...?
...should love to correct your error. 
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Of course, Commendatore...
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
...your <u>scar</u>..?
You know America?
I require...
...Franklin.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.... yes...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
No, I don't get you...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
You look lovely.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
You're <u>free</u>...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Why?
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
And why should we believe you?
...but:  this particular statue...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
Yes.
...would you use a small word?
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
That's right.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
I..
When?
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
My encounter.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Have you ever thought of instead                            ] of making children more equipped                            ] for reality, we should make reality                         ] more equipped for children?                                 ]
Don't say that.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
I'll think about it.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Where did you get these?
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
No way, no day!
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
There are no stupid questions.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Chick-en.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Did to.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
How do you turn the fucker off?
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Turn that back on!
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Come on, sit up.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Can I go now?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
You're such an incredible woman.
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
GWEN?
What's the occasion?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
Who's Allison?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
But... I thought...
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Thanks.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
What's under that sheet...?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You got a drinking problem or what?
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
Often, uh.
It's November.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Underbelly!
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
What picture?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
Never reach out!
You didn't?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Do you do washing machines, too?
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Do you have a family?
Baby, what is it?
A man?  Was it a dream?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
I could take a cab on the way home.
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, calm down.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
But it's what we want.
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear what he said?
Honey, are you okay?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Where should I hide the car keys?
Did the cleaning woman come?
He wants to see me!
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
No.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Who are you?
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
I'm sure they will.
Living.  Remember?
Yes.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
That doesn't matter.
Sometimes.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
I'll be fine.
New York is dangerous place.
Why?
That makes you uncomfortable?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
No.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
He's in there!
We're holding the workers down below.
It has to be.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Is there anything else you need?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
No.  The money, please.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
The car.  All you want is the car?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
I overheard him with the girl.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Give me an ETA.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Mine, too.
You leave that gun alone!
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
What are we going to do about Mike?
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
That's not enough.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
He didn't say.
Louise?
Chief, base.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
It's right in front of us.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Yes.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Name a price.
Ten.
Give me it.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
I don't understand.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The police are very busy.
What do you mean, General?
You lie.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
You will tell them the truth.
You have no whiskey?
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Perfect timing.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Who did you call?
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
I will need a suite.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
What?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
They do not have your connections.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Oh, my God!
Paul, don't let them die.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
This won't do.
They are being evacuated.
You could leave, Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to go out to get food.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
It was substantial.
I want to know.
Please, please try one more time.
Oh, my babies.
That is why they call it coach?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
What is this about no water?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
What?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Uhhhh...
I'll meet you down there.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
This is the best we're gonna do.
Where did it go?
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Where is she?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
I was in the middle of --
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
Sorry.
Fascinated.
I'll take my chances.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!
-- hey! --
What's the matter?
Town records are coming up now.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Can I do it again tonight?
Are we leaving mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Do you think I'm a fool?
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Oh, that's nice...
Your daughter's been taken.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
You must be the new tenants.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Keep talking!
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not on station time.
Hello?
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Sure.  Why?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
What ... What ... ?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Yes. 53
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Eighth room down, babe...
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
We're going in from the ground floor.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Yes.
You certainly do.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
This is the worst night...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Thanks for sharing.
If you do anything to my friend...
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
The Daddy-Oh!
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
What a horrible little person.
Cigarette?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
I'm sure I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
...Certain people are --
...Huh?
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
...The people look like ants.
Your i --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
I filed it yesterday.
You can't print that!
Terrific.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Norville.
Oh, geez.
...Yeah, go ahead.
...This'll only take a moment.
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
Finally.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
I'm afraid so.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
She can never be cured?
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
And charming?
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
Well?
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
An accident at the mill?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Good night.
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
What?
Don't start.
It's a starting place.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Well?
You're not going to --
I'm not.
Ready to go?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
So how's school treating you?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
But...
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
It's what?
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
But not too ashamed.
See ya.
Do what?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Maybe you should have just a half.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Who said so?
Sure.  Twinkie?
With who?
Is this Charles?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Wendy.
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Nice kid.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
You did your homework, Officer.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
This murder was in the papers, right?
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
So?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Eight years.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
What if someone finds out?
Did you love her?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
How should I know?...
You don't know.
Who?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
Nothing if not vampires...
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
If you say so. You are innocent.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Are these not the answers you came for?
Your melancholy eyes...
I want some more.
I didn't realise.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
I want more.
Claudia! You did that?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
You've just done it -
Come, you're going to feed now.
And if I don't?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Lestat!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
You can't look at them...
Can a vampire feel love?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Yes.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
No.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
You get any sleep at all?
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Be careful, Julie.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
You sure?
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
You sure it's okay with you?
Why are you doing this to me?
I trusted you.
Is there a problem here?
Hey --
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Rio de Janeiro!
Not anymore.
Cool.
Can't talk right now.
Where is everybody?
What is up with that weirdo?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
What would I be thinking?
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
There is something evil about her.
It makes me fear her.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
How did she die?
I have had command for the last time -
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Who?
Carter  bank examiner.
Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Made what?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hiya, George!
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Want to give my flower a drink.
What?
It will?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Goodbye, everybody!
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Yes, you bet.
Got a match?
George.
Nothing.
No, George, don't . . .
Violet Bick!
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Pop!
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Me?
Too young or too old?
If I told you it might not come true.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
You can?
Come on, you guys.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Where're we going?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
We're carrying weight.
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Aren't you off-duty?
I never heard of a 908.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
I passed out, but I'm okay.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Me neither.
May I have this dance?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
So there's one around here.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Let's get the kid home.
It's good with coffee.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
I know what you're going to say.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
What're you going to do today?
What're you doing?
We're alone.
Are you serious?
We have to do something.
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Some people.
How old is your cousin?
Nope.
Maybe it's gone.
The wind drift is lateral.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
About damn time.
I don't care.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
When are we going out?  You and me?
No.
Brody's riding his tower.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
What is it, 97 days?
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Yeah.
Honey... you all right?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Where are you going?
And leave me down here???
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Yes.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Fine piece of engineering.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
What's up?
Yes.  It's faster.
It's too soon to move him.
Honey, what is it?
Yes, you can.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Who's going to do it?
I am.  You're not.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Some miss all their shots.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
How come?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
I don't know, what else is there?
Yes, it's great!
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I don't talk that way.
Yes, there is goes.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
The world's southern most reaches.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
How far away is filter number four?
No way.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
Come on, sweetheart....
But you always let me....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
What's wrong?  What happened?
You knew...?
You want to try your hand at something...?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
You're coming, aren't you...?
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I'm just getting started....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Okay.
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
No....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
It was no accident....
I don't know how....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
You promised me a drink....
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
What?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Matt?
You tagging them...?
The females have eggs....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Bad boy....
What?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'Snuck up on me....'
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
You don't like my voice...?
Holy Christ....
I've got to get to her....
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
All the time....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
I'll do it, Jake.
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Cow tipping?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
Maybe?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Where is everyone?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Did he shut you down?
Did I say he did?
Sure.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Bits.
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
How do you know her hair's black?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
Once.
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Has he got your aunt's address?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Interview over, Blattis ...
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Two or three years ago.
Is that Margie?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Who told you?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Oh Jerry.
I see what you're saying.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Do you have something to drink?
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
What --
I don't need you to "stick."
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I'm sorry, I --
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Great word.  Towel?
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
You never had The Talk, did you?
I'm a little worried --
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I'm asking you a question --
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
You...
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Nothing.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
ALAN!
Anything good?
Raptors, mostly.
But then you never get to go in space.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
How did you know?
It matches the pictures.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
What?
I don't even know this woman.
Which one?
How could you possibly?
Okay.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
No way.
Lava?
Come on!
We can't stay in here!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Where's Kelly?
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
What now?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Pretty sure.
Did I say jerk?
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
- - barfs them up - -
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Ellie, com one!!
Come on, let's go.
Unpredictability....
Dino droppings?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
What'd I touch?!
The kids okay?
I didn't say you were scared.
I know.
Can't you stop these things?!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Go away!
Watch how it eats!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
What works?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Don't do that!
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
What?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
So?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You know how to use one of those?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
My assistants, I presume.
Yes -- we do.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I don't know what you could have read.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
What an extraordinary request!
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
No, sir.
Well, I --
I've never seen you here before.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
What of it?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Gabriela ...?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
Do you?
... Why take me into your confidence?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
Oskar!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
I photographed it extensively, father.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
What's that?
Guess!
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Don't belong?
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Look -- could I use your phone?
Why isn't he locked up?
Like for you to look for the man.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
You said that.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
No.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Not much point to this, is there?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Arlyn Page.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Where'd you spend last night?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
You wanted to, or you are?
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Well as a matter of --
Some mistake perhaps that --
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Two years ago? Sorry.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
No.
No.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Well?
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Yes sir, we know he --
Ladies and gentlemen...
On earth.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
I'm sorry...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Sleep tight.
See.  That's my name.
Did mommy ever see this?
No, she never did.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Where will my toys be?
Objection!
Yes.  Very much.
So do I.
Eight, almost nine years.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
I suppose...
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I consider it less my failure than his.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I'm not taking him with me.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Three months.  How can you tell?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Yeah.
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Thelma, if I die--
Again?
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Did you receive the letter?
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
You could buy them.
In the Pacific Ocean.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
America, we shall see.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I leave tomorrow.
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
The Chinese.
Yes.
You will not come?
I will miss you.
Completely.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Like my mother.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
You're a beautiful woman.
And you like me.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
You ready on shore?
Where is he?
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
I'm okay.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Like little children.  You okay?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
What?
You're mushing it a little around the--
Are we crazy?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
Well...
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
If you get a safe shot...
What kind of backup do we have?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
Kelly.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
I'm not even a field person.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
What'd I do?
Boy, is that smart...
Why not?
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Where?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I will... I promise.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I am, yes.
It's much better than your shoes.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Your bleeding has stopped.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
The death of my father.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No. Tell me why.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
Later, listen, I'll -
Early. Still dark.
Where were you going?
What...?
Time, Pilch! My move.
Are you alright?
Let us go, miss.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
"Some"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
That is sedition! Treason!
Head for... for the white water.
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Yes, sir.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Advance, Sergeant Major!
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
La victoire.
And?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Okay, number 23's full.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
How far away is she?
What are you going to do to him?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Answer them and quit kicking me!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
What's wrong, did you miss me?
I'll kill him!
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
There are no others.
Nope.
Yes?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
So do you know these geezers well?
No.
Where?
Invitations.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
I hope this is the right move.
What do you mean?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
For half a million?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I can't help you, Plank.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
How the fuck should I know?
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
No, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Please.
You're dismissed, Private.
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Private Johnson!
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
A .45--
So is Buddy on your short list?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
That's not the point.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
Whole different story; isn't it?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Do I seem jumpy?
Come on in--
I got a pretty good guess.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Didn't have a father?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Tanks, huh?
Made some money, came back here--
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
That ring--
Good deal you were born down here, then.
Yeah. I bet he would.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Senora Cruz?
I have some friends who have had a accident--
This girl has a child?
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Seems like we have another one every week.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
You go by your old house?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Charley Wade.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Buddy Deeds--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
He was killed.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
He squeezed money out of you?
What's she singing about?
I only went for my last two years.
Morning, Sheriff.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You've got your mother, your kids--
So what are we gonna do about this?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Uh-huh.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
You don't need to cuff me.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
Otis what?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Uh-huh.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Who is he?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
You ever been married?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
About?
I could scoop them out.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
What's the connection?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
So why did you marry him?
What did you find?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
I told you --
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Oh God!
I'm here, Harry.
What the fuck?
What about me?
Bad show last night?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
What are you, my mother?
We've never met.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
I don't think the dead much care.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
I can't let you in.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
What about?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
This is where we killed him.
I don't know.
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
He's not!  He's not!
You could still help me do that.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, I was looking at you.
We established that we have no communication.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
I know.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Nice one.
You think so?
Why are you crying?
Yes?
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
What?
When are you coming home?
Hello?
Why do you have to defend her?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
How'd it go today?
Yeah.
Lauren?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Peter, where are you?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
What?  That's horrible!
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I don't know.  What are they?
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
It's the patient's request, doctor.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
You'll do it?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I don't understand what's going on.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
We needed to know all we could.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
Plenty of time.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Good seeing you again.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Need any help?
To that stewardess?
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
Are you okay?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
I can take it.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You might be the only one with a job.
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
What's that?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Kay.
I don't.
Hey.
You having fun?
Early night for you, isn't it?
Figures.
What?
You do see me standing here, right?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Forget Tonya Randall.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Sorry about your game.
You weren't at my game.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
When did you decide all this?
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
We won the championship.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Maybe go back to school.
Something was just missing.
From basketball.
I'll play you.
One game.  One-on-one.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Nona, please.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Quincy, please...
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You came out early.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Still is, so let yourself out.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
After five years.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Good.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Your teeth are straight.
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
Yeah, but I don't know --
Yeah.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
Bit messy.
Yeah.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Yeah.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What?
Can I tell you something?
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
What?
I'm sorry --
I've got troubles.
No, what's wrong?
Diet Coke.
What happend, what's going on?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
I'm a rapper.
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
Did you listen to me?
You're a friend of the family I presume?
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
I paid you back.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
No.
Yeah.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
Does you mother still work?
She's my mother.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
I'm sorry.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Psychology major?
...are you Phil...?
Is Linda here?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
What does it look like?
I preffer to stand.
I don't know a loud crash.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
You look great.
Love you too..
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No.  No.
I don't.
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Did you ever touch her?
I really don't know.
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Want me to wake her up?
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
What are you doing?
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Bottled Water?
Ok.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Should be one-thirty.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
God smiled upon us.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Your Majesty...
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
What do you propose to do?
Who is he, Aramis?
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
But --
You're a fool!
No!  Stop --
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Whose rooms are those?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
You dead yet?
What number did you tear out?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Sire, I --
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
What do you need?
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Did he harm the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
What?  Wait a minute -
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Where up north?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
No, but I'm listening.
No -
Tubbs, it's me.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
A bank?
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Are you going to be alright?
Long gone, huh?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
Read it.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
As long as they're dead...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
What's one way?
No other possibilities?
Is it weird?
The mark? Yes.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Tell me now.
Get me a plane!
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
What?
What's that?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
How far away's the back-up?
Where the hell's Graham!
How did you come to Gateway?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Do you see?
Not me.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
In a holding cell.
She'll be in, in the morning...
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
What the hell can I do?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Come home with me.
Will?  You could come up here.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Yes.
Are you gonna kill him?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
You went in the apartment?
No.
And Hobbs died?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Stuart is fine.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Fight what?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
George, I hate sitcoms.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
How long would they let me sleep?
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Ten.
Right...
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Go away.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Are you at peace with your family?
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
I saw Michael!
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Bob.
Then the informant is real.
You don't know.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
Don't be ridiculous.
Sorry.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
They'll be able to track it.
No!  It's too far away.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
This isn't real?
Do you understand, Neo?
The beginning?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Morpheus, I don't know --
We need an exit.
How...?!
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
Who?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What's funny?
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
What the hell is this?!
Why?
What is this thing?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Are you worried?
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Neo, how did you do that?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
No.
How much time?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Can't we come with you?
'Thou art then a king?'
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Please take it.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
What is it now?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
What's the matter with this kid?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You mean it's heisted.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Of course.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
I wasn't going to say --
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
A voice?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Me, too.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
Mind if I throw up?
I don't care.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Don' be facety, woman.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
I am.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
You love Allison, don't you?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
No, I'm not.
To bed.
You first.
-- Could you?
'Threw' you?  Where?
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Why didn't you stop me?
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Yes.
You fill the bill, Bill.
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you?  Are you there?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
Time.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
We're all here, Bill --
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
I hope so.
...There's a start for a meeting.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Don't get carried away.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
So what's wrong with that?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
We've met.
What?!
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
I don't understand.
This is crazy --
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
I could be her.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Did I say something wrong?
21.
Burt.
I have no memory.
Seen you together, that's all.
Shit. Wrong room.
No, let's go.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Who did this to you?
Why?
They treating you alright?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
Such as?
What do the police think?
Kill him.
What are you gonna do?
Don't say another fucking word!
Sweet.
Dying.
There's a dress code?
Did Teddy send you?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
Thank you.
It's good.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Yup?
Lenny, is that you?
Why are you here?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
We've got to get him out of here.
So was he scared?
What's wrong with this one?
Why are you following me?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
You do.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Havana.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Where's she now?
How's he not your husband?
You know how improbable this is...?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
Is this the protective male talk?
If they attack you...
No part of it wasn't real.
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
What is it?
Stevens?
Anything?
What do we got?
To the limit.
Where?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
I am asking.  You to me.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Then you should.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
And...?
Define small.
And as an investment in the future...
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Then what were we talking to you for?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
You ain't coming to work?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
You like it? Take a look.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Yeah, well, so?
You got a comb?
Tell her, Ratso.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I read it.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Listen, I gotta have money.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
You really want to do business?
... and taxi fare for me.
...He had a bald skull and...
History, man, history. How much?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty months?
Years?
Want me to take over?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Yeah. How's Mom?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
About ten kilometers.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
But just...
What's your father do?
And you?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
That doesn't seem so bad.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
How long?
What's wrong?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Yeah.
Oh we... we...
I want to cut his throat.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Hishradyo.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Lady...
Peter...
Look, I showed you my badge...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Wait a minute-
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Can we get this car there?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
Rub it on the windows!
What?
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
What do you want to know?
Sure.
I'm not much of a critic.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
No, what is it?
The profanity bothers you?
I guess that means it's okay.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
The Sistine Chapel?
I DIDN'T...
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Misery's Return?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
A toast?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Well, it certainly says you.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
You've been out of your room.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Maybe.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Stop--stop right here.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Just leave it, all right?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Buster.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
How do you that.
Mmmm.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
To win?
Then don't say it.
Sort it all out.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Range is two kay.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
Care to wait a decent interval?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Are you okay?
No.
No.  Should I?
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Excuse me?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Yes.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I don't.  No exactly.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Now how to get in there.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
That's S.O.P..
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Always.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
What happened to Jim?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Kittridge...
I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
This is Kittridge.
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
Certainly Ethan.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
What makes you trust me?
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Why?
Then what am I doing here?
Why not?
How was Chicago?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Yeah.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
And get a doctor.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
That's what we do isn't it?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Okay.
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
Maybe.
Here.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Fast.
Why what?
No.
Stupid.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
I'm telling you your life!
Because I have no Luck!
What about Johnny?
I've never seen a moon like that.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
Snap out of it!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
That was just so... awful!
What do you want to do now?
Yeah.
Let me go home.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
What?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
What do you mean?
What time is it?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
So we'll sell the house.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
And we'll sell the house.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Are you drunk?
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
That's incredible.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Go ahead.
I guess you can't invite me in?
You mean the whole house?
It's a house.
Is who down there?
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
Burn her anyway.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Through ... We found them.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Please!
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
Stop that.
I'm invincible!
You're a looney.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
What with?
We shall attack at once.
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
Oh, shut up.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Be quiet!
Shut up!
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I'm ... your son ...
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
What?
What is your name, handsome knight?
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Well ... yes ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
I speak as I find, Archie.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
What?
The good-looking one.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
The place is a mess.
Yeah.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Gesture?
By whose authority?
We --
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
No.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Surely --
She'll never understand it.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Yes, ma'am?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
What did he want?
Erysipelas.
Who told them that?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
From whom?
Why is he not here?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
It is.
Then leave her.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Jesus Christ!
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Put in a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
You don't get it, do you?
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
I'm okay.
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
"Escape"?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Yes...what is it?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Wow!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Are you okay?
Betty.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
No ..........I.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
There's nothing?
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Those men in front, in the car.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Yeah, what for?
I just wanted to come here.
Go ahead.
Not a coke or anything?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Why should we trust you ?
I'm working on it.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I'm not listening.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
What do you mean ?
Is it over ?
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Knock yourself out.
Don't.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Well ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
One moment dear... 
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
What did you hear ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
No I am not.
What was that ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
What happened ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
He was right behind me !
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
This is California, anything is possible.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What about giving the other guy a break.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Suspended from school, my mother??
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Pommeroy.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
You are?

Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Hi.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
But I wanna write about her.
Hi.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
He's writing. Hello?
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Boy, you're really into this.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Come and get it.
DON'T!!!
It's dangerous!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Nick?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.

Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Maybe.
I should do this myself.
Phil for God sake.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Is there milk in them already?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
What do you mean?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
He's so tiny.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
You are perfectly healthy.
It's there.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Hi.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
It's nice.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Do you want to?
Want to what?
Yes.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
She likes to play bingo.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
In the garage.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi.
Hi, is Vada home?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
How much does it cost?
No....
We'd love to hear it.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Why?
Really?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Yes it is.
No.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
I won, I won!!!
Goodnight.
Hey look at this, no feet!
At what?
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Heaven.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Don't DO that!!
Come on, let's go.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Blood oath.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
We'll never be the same.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
You flew all the way h...
Go figure you.
The man you love.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Don't you have to be somewh...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
I mean, he loves his job.
Exactly what?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
It doesn't say th...
I thought Michael was picking me up.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
No accents today.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Right here.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
What do you really want?
What?
They can come to the concert in the park.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Barbara Jean.
That's what he wants.
Where are you going?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Your brother?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
You in music?
Wrecks.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
Well...How have you been?
I don't know who you are.
Oh.
I can't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
That's what you said before.
They said go see the chaplain.
It's me. What is it?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Hello.
For him?
What National TV...?
You're not.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Hello.
Why?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Southern California.
I know a couple.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ah... Peter Finch.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You sure do it loud.
Oh, why thank you.
What did you think then?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah.
Say something.
What?
Do you have a back up.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Then was it worth it?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Sure.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Roger?
What the hell happened to you?
How 'bout Mallory?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
But how can you say that?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They done that too long in my family.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Okay.
Used to be. On the railroad.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Where was your father born?
And his age?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, I been there.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Your folks live there?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
Get out of here!
That's why you come back, huh?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Well, what d'you think?
Is that so?
Uh-huh. Why?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Duff--
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
What 'you signifyin'?
They all got families to support.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Easy...
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
You ran without us.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
I don't have a girl.
You're pleasant tonight.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
We got problems topside.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Yo.
Less than thirty minutes.
What about the route to the core?
Hello, Case.
I thought you already left.
And we really do have to talk.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Why should I want to meet him.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
On a good run... yeah.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Won't that mean you're dead?
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Case...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
...And if I guess wrong?
Get up.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Oh, man! Who told?
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
No Roger from op/ed?
Guess who I did it with last night...
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
How many times have I fired her?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
Hey there.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
I know.
Why do you do that?
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Well, a ball player.
Shock.
Yes.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
Help me with this thing!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Where's Jesse?
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
What the hell are you talking about?
Who told you to choke up that way?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Anything?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Who, Jesse?
Jess?
So, school going alright?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Morning.
Hi, Kerry.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Hi Mom.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Girl, what are you doing?
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
So?
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Crossed over?
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Just until we get things under control.
For what?
Try me.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Remember -- open mind.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
Somebody else is out here.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
We're here.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Sorry about that...
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Here we go.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
My son's name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Who was Gilda?
Can I stay a bit longer?
What?
That's not true.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Okay.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Sorry about that.
Yes.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
No -- it's my 22nd.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Ah... yes, enormously.
Definitely no comment.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
No, sir.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Try 'Flintstone.'
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Maybe.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Yes.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Will you come with me, please.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Oh, I had them removed.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
So do I!
You men remain seated!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
That's okay, kid...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Ahhh, Billy...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
They must be up there!
Ya know what, Fred?
Martini!
What are you doing?
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Okay, sucker.
Don't you have any clubs?
No!
Yeah, Mac?
He's not!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Time out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Oh, yeah?
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Hey, how ya doin'?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
He's in charge.
Yeah!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
On what?
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Is everything all right?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What's that?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
So, what's the story with your friend?
No, really.  What's she doing?
What?...
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Who's dying?
No.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
But Faith--
You...
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Why can't you just tell me?
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Where's Positano?
Oh.  That's nice.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What are you doing here?
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
What would you call it?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Really?...
Tonight?
Wait.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
So?...
Is that bad?...
Does Dwayne know about this?
You okay?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
'Course he does.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
No... Like a psychiatrist.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
And you are?...
Oh.
How old are you?
Huh?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
That was the idea.
Working hard?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
None of your business.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Listen, you like beer?
Wham... .
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
His racket?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
What are you crying for?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts you're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself.
I've been sittin' in the church.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
About Edie?
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
...walk?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
You still call it ratting?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Not a dent.  Perfect
My favorite little cousin.
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Go on, beat it!
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
If I could get my hands on you...
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Be careful!
You do?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
What kind of symbol?
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Then cancel my order.
They are live ones?
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Glenn Michaels.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
He'd call every once in a while.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Where in the hell are we?
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Her phone's probably tapped.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Whatta you think?
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
You know how I felt about her.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Come <i>on</i>.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
What do you want to bet?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Karen, I told you not to--
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Of course I am.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
We still talk, though.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Think I could have them back?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Why not?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Don't leave me.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Oh, God...
What were you gonna do with me?
To warn her about Chino.
You just did, for Christ sake.
So.  What's your point?
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Like what?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
What's going on, Glenn?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
How's it going?
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
You not with probation, one of those?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
It's beautiful.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You used to like it.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
No?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I didn't have time.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Thank you...
Faux goose down.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
...the fuck is this...
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
You're Walker, right?
Sir?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
How could you do this?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
So what are you saying?
How come you're not pukin'?
It's tight.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Maybe just trying to measure up.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
Our doctor's gone too.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You take care, Dorie.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
I'm not telling.
Do you have to wear that hat?
I can't. It's all too much.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
How do you feel?
Want me to drive you home later?
Would you?
Looking good out there.
Yeah. Like that.
Charlie, how are you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Charlie, let's make love.
Charlie. About last nights..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Just take a look at it. 
Forget it, it'll never work.
I've got to go now.
Charlie? Was I dead?
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Don't get your hopes up.
What're you doing here anyway?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Is that one of your poems?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I closed my Christmas club.
He'll win.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
How do you feel?
What happened to you?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
I	know what a burrito is.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
What are you talking about?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
What will they be made of?
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
What's the matter?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Yes... why?
Is something wrong?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
What's his name?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Why are you getting dressed?
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
One hour!
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you.
Close the law book.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
One week old.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Thanks for your time.
Find a lawyer?
Rayisha.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Uh huh...
What have you prayed for?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
What kind of person is that?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Rach.
Gay movies.
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Objection!
Objection!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
That's correct.
We won.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
How many do you know?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
As fast as you can.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Step aboard, Carolyn.
What do my eyes see?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
So now you know.
He used that?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
He can pilot?
How much?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
We cannot go through there....
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Company's not here, is it?
I don't suppose....
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Frightening thought.
One is all?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
She's the captain, we should listen to --
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
How did you know we'd come here?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
No.
Look -- she remembers.
The evidence was very meager --
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Climb off me, will you!
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Scarecrows?
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
She comes along too.
I want her.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
The Hunt Club.
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Thats a lie!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
What about me?
No.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
We can't.
This is his assertion.
I SHIT on all o' you.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Okay - got light duty, three days.
No, thanks...
...there's nobody.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Whew! - where that come from?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
I didn't like it.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Not tonight.
The brush-off, huh?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I think you're drunk.
What did you say his name was?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
I don't.
There wasn't any plane.
Dance? Tonight?
Dance? Here?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
All right--following me.
Why?
Nothing matters.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
No percentage in that.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
Do you have to leave the note?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
If you're doing all this just for me.
In a way.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
I think you mean that.
Who told you I was married?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
What this?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
What are your rates?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I never notice the view after the first week.
That must hurt.
The only answer I have for you.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Recently, then.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Go live in a tent.
Open it and count it.
I've met her.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Oh nothing.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
How about Magruder?
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
You already have the checks, darling.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
It's terribly good.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Good.
Again?
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Jeremy phoned this morning
In your car
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
To the Fleet.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Ha ha...
Perhaps I will, then.
Still in love?
Fuck off.
I'm not here.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Oh no!
Ah, Susy, it...
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You first!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I'm not armed.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Why should I?
Wild ride, huh?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
How was the beach?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
So what'd the other guy look like?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
My name's Johnny Utah!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
No way, old buddy.
Who's our back-up on this?
We're going to need everyone.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I'll see you there.
You're looking well, Dutch.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
No.
I never joke about money.
Three hundred.
What?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Uh-huh.
Why?
Vivian --
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
What?
Did you buy some clothes?
I'm sorry.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Huh?
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
My what?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We're letting them slide?
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Why do you want to know?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Did I wake you?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
You bullshittin' me?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Miss Vivian --
May I help you?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
Rest, Highness.
And what am I?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
Did you say, "I do"?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
-- what? --
-- Fezzik, please --
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
I don't understand.
Okay.
Yellin.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
No.  To the pain.
Now?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Because I know something you don't know.
Get used to disappointment.
Kill me quickly.
Let me explain-
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Morons.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Guess what.
What?
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
"Honeymoon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Help!
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
What scheme?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I already have.  Come on.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
I never should have listened to you.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Liebkind, no!
Max, I...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Do you need us?
Get car.  Get car.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Ta.  Ta.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
What do you do best?
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
You out to buy a motel?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
No.
How did she pay you?
And when she left, she never came back.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
If she paid you well?
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
What?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Were there any calls?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Like what?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Is something wrong?
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Yes.
I ought to call the police right now!
Where... can I stay?
Where's the old highway?
Why can't I go out there with you?
Just wait here?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Yes.
You going to wait here for me?
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
For what?
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
That's it. 
Is anything wrong?
Oh?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
Do what?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Mother, please...
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Thousands?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
What were you dreaming about?
Yes.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
Well, I do say it.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
What do you think I am?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Which one is me? The horse?
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Almost certain.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Nobody.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
You were pretty bad, huh?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Don't mention it.
But Rose...
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
All right, what do you know?
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Of course not!
What do you think, Brother?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Wow! Brrrother!
He kissed her.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
A wonderful woman, boy.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
How goes it, darlin'?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
You're so sweet.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Oh, yeah?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I was going to tell him.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
What... ?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
I can work this.
No you can't.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Wh... what... ?!
What about him?
Gimmie a butt.
Wha... ?
Birth control's important.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Can't you say something nice once?
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
Nope.
You going rogue on me?
Can't I?
Well, sir...
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Can't be worse than you.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Dead.
How'd we do?
Come again... ?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
You see that?
But I have no sister.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Jabba's palace.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
I have felt him, my Master.
They are clear, my Master.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I thought she was with you.
I...
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Lando, grab it!
Here we go again.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
What do you remember?
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Told you, did he?
Well, I'm sorry.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Certainly not!
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
We must have a blow-out.
I'm coming with you.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh....Say something.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
You know this earth - this person.
A decision had to be made.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
...How's the turtle food this week?
I think it's closed.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's only temporary.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...I can't beat him.
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
...Paulie. Stop now!
What?!
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
A hundred an' thirty.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
No action.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
What's happened is freak luck.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
...Sure.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Sure I like her.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
They?
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
You shot Roger.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
So what do you want me to do?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
I've already seen your photographs.
What the hell are you doin'?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Have patience!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
He shall be endured
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Welcome.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If my heart's dear love--
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
What in bloody hell is going on?
About time!
Now, what did we steal?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
There's been a slight problem.
In here...
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Bullshit!
Is it done?
How so?
He's tough, your American friend.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
To see a man about a thing.
As in, they own it?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
I do.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
I wanted to see who you were.
Know what?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You know him?
It's my job.
You sure?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Seven thousand...
It won't work.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I've got one condition.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
What are you thinking?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
And how do you figure we do that?
You said that last time!
You think he's bluffing?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
We've got to go now, then.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
It's NOT too late!
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
What are you proposing?
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What for?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
Nothing happened?
And I'd take it out on him.
I know.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
I don't know, Booth.
Yeah, I've seen him.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
What are you getting at?
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Have I seen her?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Dwayne put the gun down --
We're out of here.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Oh Jesus Christ...
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Is that the mail?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
This whole place?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I don't think so.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Well, hurry up.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Where are you going?
Not Yu.  You!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
What?
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
How do you know he's our man?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
What?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Hello, Benjamin.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Carter...
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
What's going on?
Master Ching taught me.
Baby Duck?
Do you still have the bills?
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Shut up!
And that, of course, would be me.
No.
What?
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Shortcut?
What plate?
Did you make the plate?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yes, I think so.
Excuse me?
Which one?
Oh no.
No...what?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Right.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Bob's in a hurry.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Nothing but net."
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
You're going to be very disappointed.
That's fair.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Always a mood killer.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
Highly suspect.
You don't know.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Can you fix it?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Yes I do!
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
A little longer for me.
I'm listening.
Ya think?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Grandma!
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I do.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
It's not true, but it feels true.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
No.
I know.
Thank you.  I love you.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
Yes, I did.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Have you had any relationship since?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
It is not --
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
It's a spice rack.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
I don't know.
Not now, Jonah --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
It's a little derivative.
Oh.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's ten.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
To the mine?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Never... never... never!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
I'm a fool.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
No.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Can be what?
You all right?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
This is what we've been waiting for.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
No ...
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
That's it?
Leave me out of this.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
What do you want from me, Colette?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
Why not?
They would have killed you too.
What is it?
I know a guy.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Why?
When? When did you ever see me use?
You don't trust me?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I'm sorry?
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell is this?
Thanks for not judging me.
It's not my place.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
What? Is it bad?
I thought you'd be happy.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
There's no motels around here.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You think that's a good idea?
What is it, drugs?
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
A private, sir?
Spit it out, Captain.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Shut up, will you?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It seemed appropriate.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
That only leaves three.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Captain, what about our deal?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
You're kidding yourself.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
And what about your own hand?
I think you're right, Keith.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Sure, Reiben.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Damn fool.  Sir.
We know.
You think he really believed it?
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Pardon me?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Hi.
For going to school?
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Lloyd.
Wait a minute.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Why?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I can put that together.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
What are you doing?
I just had a phone call.
I won?
Morning honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Lloyd?
You're going.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Dad, are you okay in there?
You will?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
Well...
I'll go.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Keymaster?
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Me?  Sure I do.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
No I didn't.
I'm sorry.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Yeah.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know.
She's very successful.
I know
Just her name.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Ooop, excuse me.
I was gonna...
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
What's your name?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
He's important to my business.
This is not my problem.
Of course I'm on it.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
So I'll talk to him about it.
I was just the accountant.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
I think it's too late.
Eight hundred, give or take.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
Have you checked the...
I would say we are now officially baffled.
That's okay.
I'm inquisitive.
You could start with an apology.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
And are the police sure about that?
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
She dumped me.
No, it's not.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Need some help, honey.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
Youre the one who got away.
Or it found us.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
I know that.
They're roomates.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
I don't play games.
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
I got a surprise for you.
Time to change numbers again?
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Shush.
What are you talking about?
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Do I?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Thanks.
What?!
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
The killer called her.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
What?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
What about me?
Always.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
It's Sarah.
What?  What movie?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
WHERE?
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Oh it did?
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Or even a good porno.
Uh-huh.
Who are you trying to reach?
So why did you dial it again?
Hello.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Guess.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I believe you...
No it's not. It was Jason.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Sidney's father?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
She staying with you?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Where is she?
You're evil.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
She's saving herself for you.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Already.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
I don't believe it.
What time is it?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
Here he comes.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Not here.
No one yet.
What?
You think it was poison?
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
I know.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Does this make it with you?
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
We don't know for sure...
What?  Assessing fines?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
This is a waste of time.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
I'm fine.
We could use about fifty more men here.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
I don't see anything.
This painting...
What?
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
Let's get along...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
It was, I tell you!
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
No sir...pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
What in...?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
If there's anything I can do, sir...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
I beg your pardon?
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
What you goin' to do?
Say it. We're beat!
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Lemme alone...
Not no more.
Comancheros...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
Ellen, move aside...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
It still worked in town.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
So do I, believe me.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
She was old.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Do I look like it that much?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
You didn't tell her!
Tenth floor.
Oh
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Ohwhat have I done?
Lady?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Never!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
We have no Juliet!
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Interesting.
Will it restore my gift?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
Yes, I saw it.
When?
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
Where is the play?
Who wrote that?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
Will! Have you finished?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
No, it will turn out well.
Another little problem.
How will it?
Good title.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
"Of love?"
Not ready? Where is she?
When the Queen commands it.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Verona again.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I do not know how to undress a man.
Oh
There is time. It is still dark.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You never spoke so well of him.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Nono.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Orsinogood name
I have spoken with your father.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
No, sir.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
He made it clear.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I don't hear this.
But not quite.
What's the problem?
What is this?
Who?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
No. Why should it?
Take another look at these two.
What?
That's all?
Just one thing.
That's right.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
Cameron?
Yes.
She hated you --
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
What I am.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
That's not him.
It tastes different.
We could put it somewhere.
I'll wait there.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
You mustn't take it so badly.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
You're sure of that.
That one, last week.
No.
It was some guy called Brian.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
What?
I don't know.
Wow.
I don't want to place you in any position --
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
Whatever you say.
What about?
Yes.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Oh, no.
... what?...
Her?
I guess so.
No thanks.
Am I what?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
How is she?
Great.
I guess not...
Buffums?
So how's Norman?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
How long you had this?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Where do you want to do this?
Jill's coming with us.
Great.
Whew.
Why not?
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
George...
Did you?
Yeah, baby...
No! Don't! Please!
-- we can't now.
-- you are.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
I'm busy, man.
Otis is dead.
-- please, please forgive me...
Who?
What!
I already said hello.
George.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Television or movies?
I've got to get her out of here.
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
How many?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... well I'm glad you told me.
-- yes.
George...
Did you?
Stop it.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
... she's very upset...
-- yeah?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
No you won't.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
-- you phony asshole --
I'm not. Maybe I am.
So what's your point?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
We don't think marriage is important.
Five times a day?
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
C'mon.
-- uhh-huhh...
Didn't you have any panties on?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
I'm terribly sorry.
Good for you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
You're kidding.
No.
I'm hungry.
You mean they ate each other up?
Are you having a good time?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes.
Yes?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Tony.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Maybe he showed me something.
Yeah.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Mom?
Danny?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
What sort of injury did he have?
Sure.
How?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
No charge?
Sure is.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
What do you want me to do about it?
He's still asleep.
Get him out of here?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
I don't know.
Yes...
Stay away from me!  Please...
Wendy...
Very nice to meet you.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
I'm intrigued.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Do I need one?
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
What the hell does that matter?
You want to know what I think?
I saw what I saw.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Oh?
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
What you say?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
But I'm fearful!
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Okay, Christy -- strip.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Yes, Betty?
Yes, Betty?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Shirelles.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Amateurs 2
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Van Cartier.
Come on, we're late.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!
What?
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
What?
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
But -- why?
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
No nothing.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
What?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Who are you guys?
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
She's gettin' away!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
It's better than ice cream.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
She said they were from her old convent.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Certainly not.
What are you spying on?
You need to sleep.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Your superiors are two days away!
Maybe you should take this.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Very few, if any.
The Widow Windsor.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
The Western Woods.
It's spectacular.
We are leaving.
What was she doing?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
People have put their trust in you.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
What... what are you doing... ?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Let her go!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
No.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Yeah.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
I ain't sure.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
What's in your bag?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
But maybe just for awhile --
Childers.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Maybe they needed it.
Yeah.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
All right then.
If you want me to.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
What you readin'?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
No sir.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
You all right, Mama?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Did Karl go to bed?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
I'm ye boy.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Naw.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Do they know about you?
I'll be.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Did you knock on the door yet?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Jesus, what happened to you?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
It's yours?
But they're all the same.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
He's crazy.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Where to?
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No you're not.
For keeps?
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What can I do for you?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Hi there, little brother.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Of course. Where else?
That's where the what comes in.
Here and there. Around.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Hey, it's you.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
No way.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Medium rare, please.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Does it now?
What else could it be?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Are these your bags?
I suppose you want a tip?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
You're welcome.
A what?
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
What happened?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
Right.  We have the same blood type...
Nellie told us about it.
They got the bull-fiddle.
Where are we running, Joe?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Now you've done it!
What are you doing?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Me?  After Sugar?
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
With ME?
I am.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Security.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
That's some nerve!
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
You all right?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Who needs vermouth?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Did he get fresh?
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
- you got to be blonde -
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Goodbye?
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
We can have it altered.
I don't care.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
What's the job?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
No - funerals.
Put it here.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Brains aren't everything.
You're entitled.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
You poor, poor boy.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Really?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Daphne -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
I sleep with my spats on.
Refresh my memory.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
You know what I love about all this?
Except its Scotch.
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Wow. You look beautiful.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
No, tell me.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Would you grab my shampoo?
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Are you sure?
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Hi.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Is he here in Borderdale?
Here it is, right here.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Hi, Daddy...
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Where was you, Daddy?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's your daddy's name?
Miss Boatwright --
That's right!
Who is they?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Good night, Mama...
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Night, son!
What did he want?
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
My head hurts.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Why the fuck not?
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
You've got a stupid accent too.
Mkay.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
The N word?
You bastards.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Who are you, kid?
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Mph rmph rm!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
And Bill?
Oh.
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
What if I just left?
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Where the hell did you come from?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's a little late for you to be up.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
So, are you on for the next one?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Is that clear?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
That's right.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Really?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Seen one like it before?
Explosive?
Taylor?
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
But how are you going to escape?
What the hell are you doing?
So close...
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Marry you?
So I've been told.
What is happening around here!!!
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
What kind of man?
You have orange whips?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
La da da dalala...
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Where'd you get this ball?
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I'm your blood.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
He's the guy Buzz.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Knock-knock.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
After we eat, Dad.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yeah.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
What's your specialty?
Won't your father help you with that?
Where did your brother escape from?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
No, I'm fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
So why do you stay?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
Very professional.
Tell your little pal to let go.
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
It's burning...
Back away then.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Thank you, Colonel.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It doesn't make any sense.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
What do you mean, he's missing?
But sir --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
What?
You don't know that.
Gimme a report, I want --
Ladies and Gentlemen...
She wired this system.
Ted, get her away from the door.
Radiation shield, you think?
Sir, about leaving --
I love secrets.
Because when we get down there --
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Beth.
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Beth --
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Looks like some sort of code.
Riordan?
It's a soporific.
It's like a sleeping pill?
I'll just boost the doses.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You want to kill him?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Don't you?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
What?
Would it work?
I don't get it.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
When did it come across?
What?
To what?
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Getting anywhere with those?
Did I?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Missed.
Gimme a second --
There is one possibility.
English?
Meaning?
Does this mean what I think it means?
No, they didn't say --
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean you don't know?
You want me to try?
Please, Ted.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
What was it?
Who's going to pay me then?
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Why didn't you say so before.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
It's what I deserve.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I'm all ears.
Well, whad'ya know...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
You talk to Carl ?
You don't look very happy to see me.
...I'm sorry.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Which way ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Sure.
Cover me.
C'mon...
All bands.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Mr. Rasczak.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
How bad are you, pal ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Uh, I don't know.
Yes, sir !
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
<U>Why</U>...?!
The Creator has not answered.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Captain, what's the next move?
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
You bringing your new friend?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I need a typewritter.
I want to rent this one.
Why?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Yes.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You're still here.
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Uh huh.
Oh, God...
The other side.
You can do it.
Yes.
No, that's true.
How's your star?
Press still works.
That's something a man could do...?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
But it'll stop the movie.
If I go to jail...?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Water or mineral deposits.
Drama Group?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Mornin', Doc...
What courthouse?
...they run on water.
How big is this horse?
Bobby, don't say anything.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Are you all right...?
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
What...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
I'm very sorry to...
Izzat so?
Thank you.
She's absolutely r...
I like you, too.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yeah.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I...I...
And you know what...?
I...
I'm only trying to...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
I can't tell.
-- she's got 'religion.'
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
I...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
I...?
Grace...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
What's the...
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
You can't write it?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
I didn't say anything to them.
I don't...
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
They're coming Fedex...
<u>Pay</u> her.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
If you do the product placement...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
George, that is so kind of you.
You hear that?
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Ben!  What's wrong?
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
It just slipped out.
I'm gonna call him.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
That happens.  To families.
I can't hear you.
Here.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Not use my words, please!
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
Cos she loves you.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
I have lava.
Queen of diamonds.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Rachel's job is she works.
What honey?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Mommy's sick, guys.
So you're okay.
How do you know?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
And when did that pass?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Easy enough.
Not to me.
WE are over.
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What did you do?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
I have a snoop.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
She was angry at herself.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
That's not wh...
You're lying.
You'll learn.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
So I'll have to order in?
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
No problem.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Where you goin'?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Hey. What's up?
He was in a concentration camp?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Yes.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
But really, you never know.
I know!
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Nothing, I guess
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Mom?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
What's tomorrow?
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hey, Mikey!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
No.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Say, Ni...
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Hello?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Three.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Scooby?
Yeah. I know.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
We don't have time!
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Cooper...
Because I'll be firing at them.
I have a lighter!
She's as good as gone...
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Dissent?
What's the meaning of this?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
My seven body orifices????
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
No, sir.
You aren't sure!
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
A shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
What shall we drink to, sir?
I'm trying to, sir.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
It was a honest mistake, sir.
What the hell is Plan-R?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
They're coming in now.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
What's the target.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Primary arming switch.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Um-hm.
Can I have some?
Intense.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
What did you guys think?
Oh.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
No, no.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
A long, long, long...
Fuck it!
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Look.
Bullshit.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Great.
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Oh, you were there?
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
Yeah!
He is.
A Porsche.
Yeah. So, what about you?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
We were?
Hi.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
No.
Why we're just standing here.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
No.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, you asshole.
Hey!
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It was a racial incident.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
I, yeah.
Where are you going?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You did, huh? Good for you.
Go.
So you think I should?
So who are you?
What do you mean?
What?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
It's stupid.
Oh, yeah?
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Alright, alright already.
I can't believe you're still here.
What's that supposed to mean?
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
About what?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
It's none of my business?
Just one?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
What?!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Diane?  Diane!
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
She thinks you went to the police.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
I know, but that was before.
I'm sorry.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
What the hell do you want?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It's from hunger.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
I'll make it short.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
What were you -- a child actress?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
It must be my new shampoo.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Who else ?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Well?
I will not have it butchered.
I don't know.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
What scene?
I need some money right now.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?

Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Hold me tighter.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Where are my cigarettes?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Yes, I am, Norma.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Whose room was this?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.
Why did she have to show up now?
Eliminate her.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Maybe it was just an accident.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But why?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Why should I believe you?
Guess! Go on.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
What are you making:
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
She did that deliberately.
But what for?
No thanks. You go on.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Nigel, get lost.
What? Palace? Hardly.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
You look at them? How?
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
But it's impossible.
Then come with me.
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You're welcome...??
I didn't --
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
First question got to be "Where."
What?
Just the man I wanted to see!
KRYPTONITE!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
What will it do?
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Thank ...you.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Oh, Superman!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Where's the handle?
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Yes! This time we got it right!
Maybe I could try --
Really?
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
"They?"
I'll try to remember that . . .
I like trees.
Genius!  --  Lex.
What's a curl?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
He has powers as we do . . .
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
You're late. Very late.
Gee, I don't think . . .
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm not so sure you do.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Awesome!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Daddy . . . ?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
This wasn't in the plan.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
He's thirty-five years old.
Albert!
Me?
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
I'd like to.
Your bookie?
Are there any more at home like you?
Hey!
He may have a gun!
Know what?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Jealous? Of what?
Super...man. Hmmm...
Screaming
Besides that.
Again???
You think he's for real?
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
La de da da...
There was a recipe on the back  --
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
What're you writing, Lois?
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Twenty-four.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Superman???
Right on the first guess.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Where do you hail from?
There.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Is that real enough for you?
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
I'm...so sorry.
What happened?
Alison.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
I'll be back around nine.
She's resting.  In her room.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
It does concern me.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
It's natural.
They can look forward to that.
Sure.
Good night, Billy.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
It's interesting.
Yes.  It's a present.
Nicole!
What's a ditty again?
What's vermin again?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Oh.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
Dolores.
Why?
What about Doreen?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Tell me about the Ottos.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Daddy?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Some more wine?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Who did they get for that?
Dolores?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Any criminal record?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
It's okay.
I don't know.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Is "he" inside?
Come on boys, break it up...
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Why?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
No...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I didn't say that, J.J.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
She knows now.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
I don't think so.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Yeah!
But...
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Like you?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
I can't
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you know about the chip?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Those lying motherfuckers!
No one must follow your work.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive faster.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
You look like handmade shit.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
And no elbows on the table!
I guess so, sir.
I guess it's possible.
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
What's that mean?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
and totally irrelevant.
Yeah.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Mine's the Eleventh.
No. Ours was damaged.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
May I ask a question?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then you are wrong.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
This is absolute nonsense!
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Kyle.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
That's not my mission.
Is this enough?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Sarah.
Why?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Here's her driver's license.
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
You've got to be kidding.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
If there was one.
No.
There's a ladder here.
There goes a thousand dollars.
That's classic.
A fresh shirt...
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Take the picture out.
What are you doing... ?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
I don't know.  A lot.
Nicholas...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Yes.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Yeah.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
Split it?
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
The key?
Hm?
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Sure.
It's not going to hold your weight.
It's still an electric shock!
Are you working with her?
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Welcome Home.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
That?  That's Hill House.
Maybe they're Mary's.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
It's not a compliment.
I like the colors.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
No.
Fuck you.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Who done it, then?
What more is there.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
What's so fucking funny?
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
You goin' back inside?
He's gotta know why.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
You look alike.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Been busy, have you.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
What was that, then?
Now who's being sarcastic?
When did you get in?
He give me your address.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
What do you think.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Not that I recall.
He alive to see this?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
How do you know?
All of what?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
How much.
Hey.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
There is?
I don't get it.
What's in it?
You've made it ... brighter.
-- You know his name is Frank.
You know I don't live with him.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
...I stank, didn't I?
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
...I guess I've been all wet.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...Mm.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Maybe.
...You bring a check?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
How's business, Dave?
Your place?
Just coffee.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
So?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...OK.
Will anyone else say they knew?
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Coffee, Ed?
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Yes.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
What's the combination?
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
What doors?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
What's going on?
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Oh no.  I smell it.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
Where did you see it?
They're all heavily armed.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
What is it doing?
We're not going to make the storage room!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
I thought you were in a hurry.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Why not?
No.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Yeah, what happened?
Yeah...
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
What did you want?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
The whole area's being evacuated.
How's it going, Truman?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
What is it you find incredible?
You've got something to show me.
Brought on by what?
How can this be?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
And what's that?
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You know my work?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
I'm not sure. A virus --
Had you.
Where are you, Mulder?
Why?
I wake you?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
What kind of infection?
Mulder --
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Very weird.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Scully....?
I don't know anything about that.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I have answers for you.
About the conspiracy?
A virus?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Well look at that.
Thank you.
You're kidding me.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
That's a secret.
Someone looking after her little girl?
Now?
You sure you want to go through with this?
What else do we do?!
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Den leuten.
Do you understand German?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
...to steal my girl.
I thought you wanted...
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
...is there?
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Must you take those?
They are - private - letters.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Just around the corner.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
You a friend of Lime's?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Getting around, Martins.
Miss Schmidt.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
All right, Calloway. You win.
Wait a minute - let me out.
What about?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Not yet.
Baron Kurtz.
...Popescu...
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
The Roumanian?
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Harry...
What else did he tell you?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Too far?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
That's a movie, you moron.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
I don't care about money.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Where'd you get this?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Why not?
What assholes.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Where are they?
No difference.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
No, I think you shouldn't.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You gotta get out of here.
That's a much easier game.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
An investment banking house.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
A poison...?
What??!?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Those aren't Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
Who killed Manzetti?
I thought you hated Torah.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
I can't say that.
Daniel Balint.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Steve...
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Which was his room?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Oh, what is this shit?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Who'd you kill?
How?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Eat shit....
Did the driver really freeze?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
No!
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
He seems to have won it.
Yes.
Where did you two meet?
In a lake.
No.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Is it a poem?
Checking out the competition.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
And where did you say you were from?
Why?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Your mother?
No.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
What is it?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I don't know... why?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
I'm still here.
No... tell me.
Absolutely positive.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
And you?
What are you doing?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Please. Will you help me?
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Esther!
Mom! We're eating!
Okay, what's the information?
Anything else?
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
What are you doing?
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Mmmyes.
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Sure, I like my leopards
I'm sick.
Don't look at it!
What, senorita?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.
What do you do now?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
On his back, I suppose.
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
No  not yet.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
	As long as my feet held out.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
What! You can't be --
We stood here once before.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
You dont say.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
What do you suggest?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Crow what?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Tomorrow?
Whos the money man?
What kids?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
No.
Hello, Jane. Its me.
I hope its not too significant.
Must I speak to you in French?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Vous tes Franais?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Yeah.
Five to three. Youre early.
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Ill be alone.
Evening. Table for one?
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Hows the boy doing?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Uh-huh.
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Fuck...
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
They lost their son. Why?
Cost what?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
I also need someone who can read and write.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Yes...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
But... why... what's the point?
We have to press home the attack!
I can't read.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
We want her burned as a witch!
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Yes.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
Yes... they were.
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
This is no good!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
No...!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Yes, but...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Who... who are you...?
What are you doing out here?
I... I never lied!
My... visions...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
I want to be with him always...
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
And how's Yurek?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
What?
Tough luck.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Boys, boys...
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
You sell anything?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
It's a little cut, nothing.
Like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Baines is packing up?
Yes, I thought that.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
We can't leave the piano
What does she say?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
You're late.  Where you been?
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
We cleared 22 here.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I picked something up on the way.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
You just worry about your end, kid.
You beat him, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
The name is Lonnegan.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Another young man.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Mother!
Yes.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
I don't know.
You see how much we have to say.
What would your mother say to that?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Not at all.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What'd he think it was to you?
What do you mean?
What about this Nunheim?
You mean that body-----?
Well, what?
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
No.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
We're just having a little drink.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
Go ahead!
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I see.  I see.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
They'll want more than your word for that.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Perfectly absurd.
I didn't knock Julia off.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
Why do you say that?
Pretty girl.
What hit me?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
You're a fine watch dog.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Finished with these?
Aren't you hot in that?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Got a nice evening dress?
I wish you'd tell me who.
I don't know.
It's the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Yes.  Nick!
Bonds, sir?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
What?
For climbing.
Ready?
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
No.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Wes--
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
You think?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Steady it out!
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
What!?
Just relax.
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
No!
What do you figure it is?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
An Iraqi?
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Which way do we go!?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Well?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What is this?
He says it's a box.
You will.  You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Jaeger?
At-at-at-at-at.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
We have to go back.
How long we going to keep this up.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Drug evasion with....
Permant cortex bond.
You've seen enough.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
Good Lord!
There goes another of your disciples.
We're leaving.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Not very encouraging.
Why are you so concerned?
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
What're you talking about?
It's working.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Whadaya mean?
Alright!
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What the hell was that?
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
A what?
Nice to be here.
What?
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Yes.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
No.
No.
No.
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Like it?
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
I don't want to see you at all!
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
I hope so, too.
But not now.
Yes, m'sieu.
Very well, m'sieu.
M'sieu ...
M'sieu Monescu!
Please.
I like you, Baron.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
The fourteenth of May.
What?
They're all right, aren't they?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Madame.
Hair?
Good night. 
You would?
Divine ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
To me he seems rather nervous.
I think you'd better go.
That's right.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
We're too late.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
But I was with him the whole time.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Is he your boyfriend?
So don't marry him.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
This is crazy.
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
April 14, 1912.
I'm sorry.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
It would be a nice change from you.
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Baloney!
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Isn't she lovely?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Where'd you get it?
What did you want a gun for?
Could I see you a minute?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
Sorry.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
How well do you know her?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
My change.
Inspector McKinney.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
<U>Me</U>!
Where did you hide it?
Care to join us?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Hello, Denby!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Can you read 'em Jack?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
--you'd go with him!
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
Thank you.
He's certainly good-natured.
What's the matter?
What!--are you crazy?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Oh, my God...
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Yes, very.  And very married.
Beauty, ain't he?
I'm retired.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Excuse me?
Yeah, you look it.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
You don't even know him.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
A which?
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Awful lot of money.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
Good God, you're really-
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
You're a little touchy about it.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I have to go.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
You wanted to talk?
I don't like it.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
That thunder's sure somethin'.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
What about all these saloons?
But -
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Sir Elliot.
I see.
I'm sure they will.
- Instant melt-down.
I appreciate your time -
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Is that any way to say hello?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Just - say it. Say it just once.
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
How is old Q?
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Boyfriend?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
And what do you call this?
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
Are you listening to me?
Sleep well?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
The back-up does the same thing.
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
You okay?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
What's the problem here?
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
How is he doing?
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
None of your business.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
What are you doing?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Right here in the van.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
You can't!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Don't tell me what to do!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
But why would Andy want me?
Well, thanks for the ride.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Hi!
B-3.
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Will you quit moving around?!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
This is ludicrous.
Reach for the sky!!
Hey, Slinky?
No, Slink --
There's no mirror.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Is that all?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I've got a present for you...
So had I.
I... I don't really know.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Did you get it?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
I was just waiting for the right time.
So my wife is lying?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Me, too.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
You all right?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Live with your parents?
How are your grades?
What's that mean?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
David --
Yes.
You may speak.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
When will you do it?
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
Yeah.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
Who?
Somewhere safe.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
What's your name?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
What do you look for?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
She's not at that place you sent her?
She hasn't called you?
What?
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Like you protected Landry?
What?
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Diane.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Because it's illegal.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Is that a promise, then?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
What? Steady like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Do you recall the school motto?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
There's no need.
Are you getting out much?
Right.
Exactly.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
You Only Live Twice?
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
God, you're sick.
Are you serious?
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Went ballistic?
What?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Bob?
Oh, please.
No, but you can bet they will.
The power was within you.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Because it's there.
I don't understand.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
I cannot be certain.
To land any closer would risk detection.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I trust your message was received?

Each man's pain is unique.
You did break in.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Did he say why?
That all you can say?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Yes!
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont!
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Flynn... you can't... I
Feel what? You okay?
A User?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Wait...I need that...
New guy...
What do you think?
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Where are you going?
Where are you off to young lady?
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Yes.
Why?
What's this for?
Thanks dear.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
She's still at my house.						*
Now what?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
He's got it.
My husband is a good man.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes what?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
No.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
What did he give you?
Yes.
No.  But I wanted to.
Do you still love me?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
And you've got one.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Yeeaoowww!!
Get going! 
I understand.
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
What's happened?
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Let me speak to Clarence.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Sonny kicks ass.
What time is it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
What kinda music do you like?
Almost four years.
What's that?
I love Janis.
You didn't do nothing.
My pimp.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
I do.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
What?
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Money problems?
That's a pretty amazing story.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Do you really mean it?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
She seems very nice.
You were a cop.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Nope.
Keep it.
Come again?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Thank you.
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
We gotta get him outta there.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Sorta room-mates?
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
A jail?  Prison?
I have to go.
"Never cry wolf!"
What?
They're keeping an eye on me.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
It's private.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Might be tight.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
More or less.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Out of here.
How much.
One way.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
How much time?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Hey.
Don't look like nothing.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
Hundred-fifty.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Open up!
You got beer?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Who was that on the phone?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
What happened to your hand?
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Least you can leave.
You've been around.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You could just leave him.
Yeah.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
From?
Stop it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
What was I supposed to do?
You heard me.  Count it out.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Husband . . .?
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Where you headed?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would I what?
Hungry?
And what does that make you?
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
How do you put a price on murder?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
It's the truth, Jake.
Come on, Jake--
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
I asked you a question.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Now, what's this?
Nooo!
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Eh?
You can't do that yourself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Mister!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
Yeah...
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
How do you want it?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
Shhh! Liar.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
But he's dead.
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
What sign?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No.
Got any cold soda?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Nice place.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
What?
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Try me.
You mean the Shaman?
I'm sorry...
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Why?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Hope is a four-letter word.
Can you make it back up?
<u>Jake</u>...
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
I need a ticket.
You got a beer?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
No baby, you got it wrong.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Who was that on the phone?
They look nice.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
...I can't remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
I've come to a decision.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Yes.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Why?
In college. A car accident.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
I thought he was carrying something.
No.
I'm not scared.
Against a window.
Was your family traveling with you?
Did you get up from your seat?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Why?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Three days. Are you hungry?
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Mmmm pistols.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Yeah?
I could run off them whores.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
And?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
A sign on him?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
I could of... easy.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
She's passed on, Kid.
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
When we gonna double back?
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, I guess so.
First one what?
She gave me the evil eye.
Well, she...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Easy, Bill.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Hullo, paw.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Nothin's bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
More.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Well, suppose he does?
Just like that?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
There was ninety-one million -
They want more time to think about investing.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
You are a criminal.
He's alright.
What fence? Who?
You have to come.
I was out of line.
Fenster and Hockney?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
You set up the line-up.
What did you say?
You're lying.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
This is totally irrelevant.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
Edie...
You think he's..?
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
How good's your intelligence?
He was accused of jury tampering.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Yes.
Objection!
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
You would not...?
I...yes.
You've just said you signed it.
I thought I would need it.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
...I made a reservation at...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
What is it?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Is this a bad time.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
And it's over...?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
No.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
...I'm going to need your help...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
What happened, Joey...?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Uh...the admitting nurse...
What did she do?
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...yeah...good...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... I understand ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
In New York?
You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
We, we were rather busy...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
The Big Boy did...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
You don't have to do it for a living.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
Then?
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
And when she goes to those places...
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
You're not far wrong.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
What do you want to know?
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Then will you for me?
Thank you again. Good-night.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie!
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Take me away...
We're going up the tower.
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Why?
Please drink your coffee.
Wander about.
One shouldn't live alone.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
The tall trees...
No, I can't tell you!
Where?
What else?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Don't leave me... stay with me...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Go on.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
To the church, I must go there.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
How do you know? Personal experience?
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
That's following a train of thought.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah.
Out!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
What did you say?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You're an asshole.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Why?
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Go home!
What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Wait. Wait a minute.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Don't talk to me about character.
What is your problem?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I know...
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
What is it?
Your investment ideas never work out.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
I think we should say some words over the grave.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Shut up Boyd.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
What's your point?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
Not true.
Israel doesn't have a King.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Photographer?
Yes.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
You expect more what?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
Take care of those chairs.
I will.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Nesting?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Buzzing?
The wahoo moment?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
What is it?
I have no idea.
Greenpeace.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Okay great. What will that be?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We will.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
Stop this, stop this.
Are there many windows?
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
And this innocent child.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes.
Nothing.
So, Ramona!
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
I don't know, sir.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Are they going to work here too?
How are you today?
Things seem to be getting better.
Are your parents alive?
Stop this!
Very, very?
What's going on, Moncho?
Don't talk like that!
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I don't know.
What about them?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Do I get to see it or not?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
It wasn't a lie.
I am impressed.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Can I ask you something?
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
What are you talking about?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
...where?
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
What is it?
...the... 
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...what's the Long View?
No rain.
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Knock on wood.
...brazen-it-through...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Courage, Mom.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Hello...?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Whaddaya think?
Is there a press conference today?
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Because.
They got to have something that we want.
...who is this guy...?
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
What?
Where is he now?
They got him standing by.
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
What?
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
...we'll gettim in their cars.
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
An anti-psychotic...
Mmm.
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Get on your feet, boy.
No, I'm On Top of it...
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
I go with this here... 
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
Public Domain.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
Long's you git me back for the beans...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
...mmm.
Yup.
Oh, hell...
... That's what you told us to say.
...if I had your looks, better.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
It concerns his future!
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Sell?
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
I don't know anything!
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
He never told me...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
What does that mean?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Hi.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you Jenkins
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Come on.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Stop saying things so loud!
I know that.
No, he wouldn't.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Did you?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
At the party.
Um...
Oh-kay...
Who?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
You do?
And then you weren't there.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
Wow.
You should have heard her play.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Well good.  So you're human.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
What are you going to do?
I think three...
What's their name?
She's awake.
It's just us now.
Wanna fool around?
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
That's not what I'm sug--
Mmnph.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
I didn't do that.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Dressed?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Norman...
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
Sweetheart--
I...
I may have seen her on campus.
Not personally.
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
I never asked you to quit!
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Shhhh.
What?
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Rowan.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
You - are - a - murderer.
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Only you...
I don't know what you are!!!
Oh god...
Harder...
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Rowan...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Their what...?
Wanna snack...?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
BRIAN...
That's right...
I don't know...
How long have you been watching me?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I want you out now
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Who the hell was your father?
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
These are real, live women?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Which you pulled, hard!
Well?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I guess.
Just say it, Dad.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Hmmm?
Can you believe that was me?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I miss them, too.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
I'm trying to help.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
He phoned it in.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
But you never do.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Do you trust me, Julie?
That's hard to believe.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Only the best for my mother.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
What kind of ideas?
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Kelly Van Ryan...
You look pretty.
And where might that be?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
I understand.
Did you try to fight him?
You mean he withdrew...
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
Where's the body?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
You are.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Sam...
How...
Hi, Sandy.
But don't pull that again.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
All that jumping and kicking.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
God in heaven, what is that?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Yes, me!
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Good work.  Really.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Easy now.
Well?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
He's no magician.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
What do you want!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What's the magician's weapon?
How??
Why?
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Is it them?
You know who?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You have no right to keep us here.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
But why would they murder...
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Home.
Who are they?
What?
Two days.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Won him over just like that.
Anybody know about this?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
What about Carter?
He's not in this building.
Is this where we're going?
Momma... are they angry with us.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Uhh -- yeah --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
To see?
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Who are you?
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
I thought you said she was dead.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
...room --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh -- 
Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
...has been simply unbearable.
Yes -- let's run!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Here -- here --
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Stop pushing!
Where -- where do we go now?
No?  Now, wait a minute.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
...of the West.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
No, sir!
That's right.
To Oz?
Yes.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Well, I --
But I still want one.
What the hell are you talking about?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Zukovsky...
Is there another way?
But what if...
Its just a scratch.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Who did you get it from?
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
Im sorry.
Yes.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
...what?
Wheres M?
One... last... screw?
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
He was a...good lover?
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What about our end?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Because --
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I won't do that.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Jon --
She's with me.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
Laurie --
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
What's he doing?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Ever see one of these before?
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
Up yours.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
What do you have?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Who are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
They tell me you're an American agent.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Did you do your homework?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
What was that for?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
This is your standard dart gun.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
What's the deal?
Why you dogging me up?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
What are you talking about?
It's too far.
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
You know, you --
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He takes his work seriously.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
The point of what?
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And who might you be?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
From your office, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
MMmmm.
Darling!
Of course.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes.
I promise.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Surprised!
Darling!?!
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Yes!... the laboratory.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Dr. Frankenstein?
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
A piece of what?
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But, sir...
Frederick Frankenstein?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Why are you talking like that?
Fro-derick!
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What a filthy job!
How?
That's not bad.
More, do you hear me?
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Yes.
Thanks...for all your help.
What monster?
That sound good, boss.
Come on, big fellow!
How's everything?
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Would you like a sandwich?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Look, Doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
A god?
Yes!
I'd be so nervous.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
What?
Are you ready for me?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???

Yes, sir, name, please?
Do you have a reservation?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
